## Timeline Philosophy

Based on the existing content, the timeline appears to follow this philosophy:

### **Inclusion Criteria**:
✅ Corruption, kleptocracy, institutional capture
✅ Accountability failures (prosecutorial, legislative, judicial)
✅ Corporate power abuse
✅ Surveillance state expansion
✅ Democratic erosion
✅ War deception and profiteering
✅ Financial impunity
✅ Regulatory capture

### **Exclusion Criteria**:
❌ Routine policy disagreements
❌ Normal political processes
❌ General news events without corruption angle
❌ Partisan disputes without systemic corruption

### **Focus**:
The timeline is a **kleptocracy and accountability documentation project**, not a general political history. This explains why:
- Trump dominates (unprecedented corruption)
- Biden underrepresented (less kleptocratic corruption)
- Bush well-covered (war profiteering, corporate ties)
- Obama has selective coverage (Wall Street impunity, whistleblowers)
- Congress underrepresented (corruption more diffuse, harder to document systematically)

---

## Conclusion

The timeline is **exceptionally comprehensive on Trump** and **strong on Supreme Court capture, Citizens United, Iraq War deception, and surveillance privatization**.

**Major gaps** exist for:
1. Congressional corruption (systematic undercoverage)
2. NSA/Snowden revelations (surprising omission)
3. Pre-2000 administrations (Clinton, Reagan, Bush Sr.)
4. Intelligence agency abuses beyond surveillance
5. Environmental and labor corruption

**Recommendation**: The timeline has achieved its apparent primary goal (comprehensive Trump accountability documentation). Expansion should focus on:
- **Congressional corruption** (most important for institutional completeness)
- **Snowden/NSA** (major accountability story missing)
- **Pre-2000 foundations** (Reagan deregulation, Clinton corporate capture)

This would transform the timeline from "Trump + kleptocracy context" to "comprehensive U.S. kleptocracy documentation 1970-2025."

**Current Status**: ✅ **Excellent Trump documentation**, 🟡 **Good broader kleptocracy coverage**, 🔴 **Major gaps in Congress and pre-2000 eras**
