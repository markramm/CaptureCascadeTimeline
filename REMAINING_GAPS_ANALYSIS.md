### ⚠️ **MODERATE COVERAGE** (needs expansion)

#### 1. **Corporate Accounting Scandals (Early 2000s)** - 15 events
**Current**: Enron energy task force well-covered, but missing scandal details
**Gap**: WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Arthur Andersen collapse, Sarbanes-Oxley passage

- 2006-10-23: Jeffrey Skilling sentenced 24 years (reduced later)
- 2013-06-21: Skilling sentence reduced to 14 years (prosecutorial collapse comparison)

**Significance**: Shows brief period of corporate accountability (Sarbanes-Oxley, actual prosecutions) before 2008 crisis returns to zero prosecutions. Arthur Andersen collapse demonstrates accounting firm complicity. Contrast with 2008 response reveals accountability erosion.

#### 2. **Opioid Crisis** - 5 events currently
**Current**: FDA approval (1995), Curtis Wright revolving door

- 2023-05-30: Supreme Court considers Sackler bankruptcy shield
- State settlements: West Virginia, Oklahoma, Connecticut details
- Deaths: 500,000+ Americans from opioid overdoses (accountability crisis)

**Significance**: Demonstrates pharmaceutical industry regulatory capture, Sackler family uses bankruptcy to shield wealth while facing no criminal charges despite knowing deception. Revolving door (Curtis Wright FDA → Purdue), marketing fraud causing mass death with minimal accountability.

#### 3. **Wells Fargo Fake Accounts Scandal** - 9 events (minimal)
**Current**: Robo-signing, regulatory capture mentioned

#### 4. **Boeing 737 MAX Scandal** - 5 events
**Current**: FAA delegation, revolving door (Elwell, Bahrami), Lion Air crash
**Gap**: Missing Ethiopian crash, investigations, deferred prosecution

**Missing Events (~15 events)**:
- 2011-01-01: Boeing decides to redesign 737 with larger engines (MCAS needed)

- 346 deaths total, $2.5B fine but zero executive accountability

**Significance**: Regulatory capture kills 346 people. FAA allows Boeing self-certification, revolving door creates conflicts, profit prioritization over safety, deferred prosecution means no trial, executives profit during mass death.

#### 5. **Student Debt/For-Profit Colleges** - 14 events (minimal)

- 2024-01-01: Biden administration approves $132B in debt relief via other programs
- Loan servicer misconduct: Navient, PHEAA/FedLoan settlements

**Significance**: For-profit college fraud traps students in debt, regulatory capture under DeVos, bankruptcy laws weaponized against students while corporations discharge debt freely, Supreme Court blocks relief while protecting corporate interests.

#### 6. **Net Neutrality** - 42 events (moderate but could expand)
**Current**: Has coverage but worth checking for key FCC decisions
**Gap**: Ajit Pai's fake comments scandal, Comcast throttling, 2015 rules, 2017 repeal

**Missing Events (if not present) (~10 events)**:

- 2018-06-11: Net neutrality repeal takes effect

**Significance**: Regulatory capture via Ajit Pai (Verizon → FCC), fake comments scandal demonstrates industry manipulation, revolving door, party-line votes show partisan divide on internet infrastructure.

## Research Priority Ranking

### **TIER 1: CRITICAL (HIGH IMPACT, CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY FAILURES)**
1. ✅ **Opioid Crisis** (20 events) - 500K deaths, Sackler immunity, pharmaceutical regulatory capture
2. ✅ **Corporate Accounting Scandals** (15 events) - Enron/WorldCom era showing brief accountability before 2008 collapse
3. ✅ **Boeing 737 MAX** (15 events) - 346 deaths, regulatory capture, zero executive accountability
4. ✅ **Wells Fargo** (12 events) - 3.5M fake accounts, admitted fraud, zero prosecutions

**Tier 1 Total**: ~62 events

### **TIER 2: HIGH VALUE (SYSTEMIC ISSUES)**
5. ✅ **Student Debt/For-Profit Colleges** (18 events) - Regulatory capture, debt trap, bankruptcy law weaponization
6. ✅ **Climate Denial Infrastructure** (15 events) - Fossil fuel industry deception, scientific harassment

8. ✅ **Net Neutrality** (10 events) - Ajit Pai revolving door, fake comments scandal

**Tier 2 Total**: ~53 events

### **TIER 3: VALUABLE (FILLS SPECIFIC GAPS)**

10. ⚪ Uber regulatory evasion - ~8 events
11. ⚪ Theranos fraud - ~10 events
12. ⚪ Pharma price gouging (Shkreli, Valeant) - ~10 events
13. ⚪ State corruption (Bridgegate, Blagojevich) - ~10 events

**Tier 3 Total**: ~48 events

## Recommendation

**Phase 6: Corporate Crime & Regulatory Capture (Tier 1+2)**
- **Target**: 115 events
- **Batches**:
  - 6A: Opioid Crisis (20 events)
  - 6B: Corporate Accounting Scandals - Enron/WorldCom era (15 events)
  - 6C: Boeing 737 MAX (15 events)
  - 6D: Wells Fargo Scandal (12 events)
  - 6E: Student Debt/For-Profit Colleges (18 events)
  - 6F: Climate Denial Infrastructure (15 events)
  - 6G: Flint Water Crisis (10 events)
  - 6H: Net Neutrality (10 events)

**Significance**: These events document the 2000s-2020s pattern of:
- Corporate crime → minimal/zero accountability
- Regulatory capture via revolving door
- Mass death/harm (opioids 500K, Boeing 346) → executives profit
- Deferred prosecution agreements replacing criminal trials
- Bankruptcy weaponized to shield billionaires
- Contrast: 2002 Enron/WorldCom prosecutions vs. 2008/2020 zero prosecutions

This phase would strengthen the timeline's documentation of accountability collapse across industries beyond finance, showing the systematic pattern where corporate executives face no consequences for fraud causing mass harm.
