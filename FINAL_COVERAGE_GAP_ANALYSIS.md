- **Helsinki Summit**: 3 events (summit, walkback, Senate rebuke)

### High Priority (Importance 8-9):
- **Trans Military Ban**: 1 event
- **Puerto Rico**: 2 events
- **Midterms**: 1 event
- **China Trade War**: 3-5 events

**Total Additional Events Needed**: ~33-37 events to achieve truly comprehensive coverage

**Timeline Would Reach**: ~2,327-2,331 events

---

## Recommendation

Focus on **Critical Priority** events first (26 events):
1. Criminal indictments and trial (11-12 events) - Historic firsts
2. Helsinki Summit (3 events) - Major diplomatic failure
3. Khashoggi murder (4 events) - Human rights and accountability
4. Supreme Court confirmations (8 events) - Institutional capture enabling future abuses

These 26 events document the most significant accountability failures and would bring the timeline to ~2,320 events with comprehensive coverage of all major Trump-era scandals and crises.
