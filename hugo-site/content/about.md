## Our Mission

This timeline documents the systematic capture of American democracy through verifiable events, court records, and public reporting. We're building a living intelligence infrastructure that helps citizens understand and respond to the erosion of democratic institutions.

## The Capture Cascade Framework

Democracy doesn't fall gradually—it **cascades**. Each captured institution enables the capture of three more, creating exponential acceleration. This framework helps explain the accelerating erosion we're witnessing:

### The Pattern

1. **Capture Oversight** → No one watching
2. **Capture Courts** → No legal recourse
3. **Capture Enforcement** → Selective prosecution
4. **Capture Media** → Public can't see
5. **Cascade Accelerates** → Each enables 3 more

### The Evidence

Our timeline shows the mathematical reality of this cascade:

- **1970s:** <1 event/year
- **2010s:** 8 events/year
- **2020s:** 100+ events/year

This isn't gradual erosion—it's exponential acceleration.

## What We Document

- **1,945+ verified events** spanning 1142-2025
- **6,373 credible sources** from court records, official documents, and verified reporting
- **3,606 tags** tracking patterns across nine capture lanes
- **3,585 actors** showing network connections and coordination

## Our Standards

Every event in this timeline must meet strict criteria:

1. **Minimum 2 credible sources** (tier-1 or tier-2)
2. **Verifiable documentation** - court records, official documents, or verified reporting
3. **Clear significance** - explains why it matters to democratic institutions
4. **Proper context** - connects to broader patterns

We adhere to strict factual accuracy. If we make a mistake, we correct it transparently.

## How to Use This Timeline

### For Researchers

- Use the chronological view to track how patterns emerge over time
- Filter by actors to see network connections
- Filter by tags to understand specific capture lanes
- Check sources to verify every claim

### For Journalists

- Find connections between events and actors
- Track how specific patterns have evolved
- Verify facts with our comprehensive sourcing
- Identify emerging trends before they become obvious

### For Citizens

- Understand what's happening in real-time
- See how seemingly unrelated events connect
- Make informed decisions based on documented facts
- Share verified information to counter disinformation

## Two Ways to Explore

### Static Timeline (This Site)

- SEO-friendly and accessible to search engines and AI agents
- Clean, fast browsing with pagination
- Filter by actors and tags
- Perfect for deep reading and research

### Interactive Viewer

- Advanced filtering and search
- Network visualization showing connections
- Timeline visualization showing acceleration
- Real-time updates as events are added
