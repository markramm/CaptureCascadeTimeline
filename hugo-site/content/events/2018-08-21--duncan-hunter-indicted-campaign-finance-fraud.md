title: "Rep. Duncan Hunter and Wife Indicted for $250,000 Campaign Finance Fraud"
summary: |
  U.S. Representative Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA) and his wife Margaret E. Hunter were indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of California on 60 counts including wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign finance violations, and conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States. The indictment alleged they converted more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filed false campaign finance records with the Federal Election Commission.

  The Hunters allegedly used campaign money for family vacations to Italy (costing over $14,000), Hawaii, Phoenix, and Boise; school tuition; dental work; theater tickets; domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives; and tens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities, and expensive meals. The indictment even revealed they spent campaign funds on airline tickets for their pet rabbits, Eggburt and Cadbury.

  The couple's severe financial problems were documented in the indictment: their bank account was overdrawn more than 1,100 times over seven years, generating $37,761 in overdraft fees. Hunter, who was the second House member to endorse Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, initially denied wrongdoing and claimed the prosecution was politically motivated, even attempting to blame his wife for the illegal expenditures. The case exemplified the casual corruption of Trump-era Republicans who treated campaign funds as personal slush funds while claiming to champion fiscal responsibility.
