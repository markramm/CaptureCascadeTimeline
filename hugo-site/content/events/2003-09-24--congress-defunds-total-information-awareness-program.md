Congress passes the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for 2004 (H.R. 2658), containing language that permanently terminates funding for the Total Information Awareness (TIA) program and orders the immediate closure of DARPA's Information Awareness Office. The Senate had voted unanimously against the program on September 30, 2003, reflecting bipartisan opposition to mass surveillance of American citizens. President Bush signs the appropriations bill into law on October 1, 2003, officially ending one of the most controversial government surveillance programs in American history.

The defunding follows months of intense public backlash after the New York Times exposed the program in November 2002, with civil libertarians and privacy advocates successfully arguing that TIA represented an unprecedented threat to Fourth Amendment protections and civil liberties. The program's director, John Poindexter, had already resigned in August 2003 following a separate scandal involving a proposal to reward investors who predicted terrorist attacks. The congressional action specifies that 'none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this or any other Act may be obligated for the Terrorism Information Awareness Program.'

However, the defunding contains critical loopholes that allow TIA's core technologies to continue under classified programs. Congress permits certain research projects to continue under DARPA, including Bio-Event Advanced Leading Indicator Recognition Technology, Rapid Analytic Wargaming, and Automated Speech and Text Exploitation in Multiple Languages. More significantly, the legislation allows the 'National Foreign Intelligence Program' to continue using TIA's 'processing, analysis and collaboration tools for counterterrorism foreign intelligence purposes,' restricted to lawful military operations outside the U.S. or foreign intelligence activities against non-U.S. citizens only. According to later reporting by National Journal in 2006, TIA's two core projects—the Information Awareness Prototype System and Genoa II—were renamed 'Basketball' and 'Topsail' respectively and transferred to the Advanced Research and Development Activity at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. The TIA architecture's legacy continues in classified NSA surveillance programs, with the same fundamental technologies later revealed in programs like PRISM following Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures.
