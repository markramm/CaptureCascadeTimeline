Former Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) was named chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), becoming Hollywood's chief lobbyist in Washington despite having "repeatedly and categorically" promised he would not work as a lobbyist after leaving the Senate. Dodd had served as chairman of the powerful Senate Banking Committee from 2007 to 2011, giving him extensive connections to financial regulation and corporate governance that would prove valuable to the entertainment industry.

## Broken Promises and Ethical Concerns

Just months earlier in August 2010, Dodd had told the Connecticut Mirror emphatically: "No lobbying, no lobbying" when asked about his post-Senate plans. His appointment to lead the MPAA—one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations—directly contradicted these public statements. While congressional ethics rules prevented Dodd from personally lobbying Capitol Hill for two years after his January 2011 retirement, his role as MPAA chairman fundamentally involved lobbying strategy, even if he couldn't personally meet with former colleagues during the cooling-off period.

## Banking Committee Chairman to Entertainment Industry

Dodd's 30-year Senate career included leadership positions on Banking, Foreign Relations, and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committees. As Banking Committee chairman during the 2008 financial crisis, Dodd helped craft the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, giving him deep knowledge of financial regulation and corporate strategy. The entertainment industry valued this expertise alongside his political stature, betting that someone of "real position and stature" could better position Hollywood as a major export industry that creates American jobs.

## MPAA Leadership and Policy Influence

As MPAA chairman from 2011 to 2017, Dodd led Hollywood's lobbying efforts on copyright enforcement, digital piracy, international trade, and content regulation. His most visible—and controversial—role came during the 2012 SOPA/PIPA debate, where he threatened to withhold campaign contributions from lawmakers who didn't support the entertainment industry's anti-piracy legislation. This incident exposed how revolving door officials leverage their former colleagues for industry benefit, drawing widespread criticism from internet freedom advocates.

## Significance

Dodd's appointment exemplified the credibility gap facing congressional ethics reforms. His explicit promises against lobbying, followed by immediate acceptance of a lobbying leadership position, demonstrated how easily former lawmakers could circumvent public expectations through technicalities. The two-year cooling-off period proved largely symbolic when former senators could immediately assume executive positions directing lobbying operations. Dodd's case illustrated how industries recruit former committee chairmen not just for their policy expertise, but for their ability to frame industry interests as aligned with national interests—transforming corporate lobbying into discussions of American competitiveness and job creation. His transition from banking regulation to entertainment lobbying showed how transferable the influence of congressional power becomes in the private sector.
