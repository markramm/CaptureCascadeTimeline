National Security Council Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient, testified to House impeachment investigators on October 29, 2019 that he listened to President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Zelensky in real-time and immediately recognized it as improper. In his opening statement, Vindman declared: "It is improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent." Vindman, who wore his Army dress uniform to emphasize his military service and nonpartisan credentials, testified that he reported his concerns to NSC legal counsel immediately after the call, making him a crucial corroborating witness to the central impeachable act.

## Background

Vindman, a Soviet-born Jewish immigrant who arrived in the United States as a toddler and rose to become the NSC's Director for European Affairs, had unique credibility on Ukraine policy. He testified that Trump's demands during the July 25 call diverged from official U.S. policy and were "inappropriate" and "wrong." Vindman described how Trump asked Zelensky to investigate "the Bidens" and the debunked CrowdStrike conspiracy theory, ignoring talking points prepared by NSC staff about corruption reform and Russia's military aggression. Vindman was so disturbed by the call that he consulted with NSC legal advisor John Eisenberg and told his twin brother Yevgeny, also an NSC attorney, about his concerns.

Vindman's testimony corroborated other witnesses' accounts of the "irregular channel" run by Rudy Giuliani that bypassed official diplomatic protocols. He described a July 10 meeting where EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland explicitly told Ukrainian officials they needed to deliver investigations to get a White House meeting, prompting then-National Security Advisor John Bolton to abruptly end the meeting and instruct Vindman and Fiona Hill to report the conversation to NSC lawyers. Bolton later told Hill that "Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up," according to testimony.

## Significance

Vindman's testimony was particularly powerful because he was a direct witness to the July 25 call—he listened in real-time, took notes, and immediately recognized the impropriety. His status as an active-duty Army officer and decorated combat veteran made him difficult for Republicans to attack, though they attempted to question his loyalty and judgment anyway. Ranking Member Devin Nunes and Trump allies suggested Vindman had dual loyalties because of his Ukrainian birth, to which Vindman responded forcefully: "I'm an American. I came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers to advise the Ukrainian government."

Trump himself attacked Vindman on Twitter, and conservative media launched smear campaigns questioning his patriotism. Fox News host Laura Ingraham and her guest John Yoo suggested Vindman was working for Ukraine rather than the United States. These attacks on a Purple Heart recipient who had served in Iraq demonstrated how thoroughly Trump's movement had abandoned traditional Republican support for the military when military professionals testified truthfully about presidential misconduct. Vindman would pay a steep price for his constitutional courage—he was fired from the NSC on February 7, 2020, just two days after Trump's Senate acquittal, along with his twin brother who had no role in the impeachment, in blatant retaliation. Vindman subsequently retired from the Army, concluding his military career could not continue after Trump's retaliation.
