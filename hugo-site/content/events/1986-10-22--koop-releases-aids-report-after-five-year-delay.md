Surgeon General C. Everett Koop releases "The Surgeon General's Report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome" after being muzzled by the Reagan administration for five years. The groundbreaking 36-page report provides frank, explicit guidance on AIDS prevention including comprehensive sex education and condom use—recommendations that anger Reagan's conservative base but represent essential public health guidance. Koop drafted the report secretly at home to prevent Reagan's domestic policy advisers from censoring crucial medical information, distributing numbered copies to control the review process.

The report marks the federal government's first comprehensive public health guidance on AIDS, arriving tragically late after over 12,000 deaths and five years of deliberate official silence. Koop recommends AIDS education starting in elementary school, frank discussion of sexual practices, and widespread condom availability—all politically controversial positions that Reagan advisers had suppressed. The Surgeon General's willingness to prioritize medical evidence over political ideology contrasts sharply with the administration's years of inaction driven by fear of alienating evangelical voters who viewed AIDS as divine punishment for homosexuality.

Koop's report provides scientific ammunition for public health officials, educators, and activists who had been fighting the epidemic without federal support. However, the five-year delay has already allowed AIDS to spread into populations that could have been reached with earlier prevention education. The episode demonstrates the deadly consequences when political calculation overrides public health expertise: thousands of Americans died while Reagan administration officials debated whether acknowledging AIDS would anger conservative voters. Koop's report represents a moment of scientific integrity within an administration that systematically subordinated public health to political ideology.
