Reagan-era S&L deregulation creates massive moral hazard by combining three toxic elements: elimination of prudential lending standards, expanded federal deposit insurance covering risky investments, and weakened regulatory oversight. The Garn-St. Germain Act removes Depression-era constraints that had prevented S&L failures, allowing thrifts to invest in commercial real estate, junk bonds, and speculative ventures while maintaining federal insurance guarantees. This combination incentivizes fraud and reckless risk-taking: S&L executives can gamble with federally-insured deposits knowing that profits are privatized while losses are socialized onto taxpayers.

The moral hazard operates predictably: conservative S&Ls that had operated safely for decades suddenly engage in wild speculation, self-dealing, and outright fraud because federal insurance means they can't truly fail—taxpayers will cover losses. Executives have perverse incentive to take maximum risk: if bets pay off, they capture profits; if bets fail, taxpayers absorb losses. Regulatory agencies, starved of resources and captured by industry, fail to supervise the explosion of risk-taking. By the time regulators act, fraud is involved in 70-80% of failed institutions, and losses have grown from manageable to catastrophic, requiring $160 billion taxpayer bailout.

The S&L moral hazard demonstrates fundamental flaw in "free market" ideology: removing prudential regulation while maintaining government guarantees doesn't produce efficient markets, it produces looting. Honest institutions can't compete with fraudulent ones offering unsustainable returns backed by taxpayer insurance. The lesson—that deregulation plus government guarantees equals disaster—would be forgotten two decades later when similar deregulation of commercial banking produced the 2008 financial crisis at vastly larger scale. The S&L experience proves that moral hazard isn't theoretical economics but practical recipe for transferring wealth from taxpayers to financial executives through systematic fraud enabled by captured regulators.
