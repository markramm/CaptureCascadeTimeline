title: "Dennis Hastert Sentenced to 15 Months, Judge Calls Him 'Serial Child Molester'"
summary: |
  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was sentenced to 15 months in prison, two years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine by U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin, who described him as a "serial child molester" during an emotional sentencing hearing. Though Hastert was only charged with illegally structuring bank withdrawals, the judge noted that "some conduct is unforgivable no matter how old it is" while referencing the underlying sexual abuse crimes that were beyond the statute of limitations.

  Federal prosecutors detailed that Hastert had molested at least five teenage boys, some as young as 14 years old, while serving as a wrestling coach at Yorkville High School in Illinois during the late 1960s and 1970s. One victim, Scott Cross—the 53-year-old brother of former Illinois House Minority Leader Tom Cross—publicly identified himself and testified that Hastert assaulted him in a locker room when he was 17 and team captain. Cross stated the violation of trust continues to scar him decades later.

  When confronted about the abuse in 2008, Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million for the victim's silence, but when his suspicious large cash withdrawals triggered an FBI investigation, he falsely claimed he was being extorted—victimizing his accuser once again. Hastert became the highest-ranking elected official in U.S. history to face criminal consequences for such conduct. The case revealed that the man who was third in line to the presidency and the longest-serving Republican House Speaker (1999-2007) had spent decades concealing his past as a child predator.
