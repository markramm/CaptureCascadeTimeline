Oracle Corporation filed a lawsuit against Google on August 13, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging copyright and patent infringement over Google's use of Java application programming interfaces (APIs) and approximately 11,000 lines of Java source code in the Android operating system. The lawsuit came just months after Oracle completed its $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010, inheriting the Java programming language and immediately weaponizing it against Google's Android platform.

Oracle's lawsuit claimed that Google violated Oracle's copyrights and patents by copying 37 Java APIs to enable millions of Java-trained programmers to develop Android applications using familiar programming interfaces. Oracle initially sought billions of dollars in damages, arguing that Google's unauthorized use of Java APIs in Android—which had become the world's dominant mobile operating system—represented massive copyright infringement that deprived Oracle of licensing revenue and competitive advantage.

The lawsuit exemplified Oracle's aggressive use of intellectual property litigation to extract revenue from competitors and assert control over foundational software technologies. By claiming copyright protection over APIs—programming interfaces that enable software interoperability—Oracle sought to establish a legal precedent that could dramatically expand corporate control over software development and restrict programmers' ability to create compatible systems without paying licensing fees to API copyright holders.

The litigation would consume over a decade, proceeding through multiple trials, appeals, and ultimately reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012, District Court Judge William Alsup ruled that APIs are not subject to copyright protection, but the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision in 2014, finding Java APIs copyrightable while leaving open Google's fair use defense. A 2016 jury found that Google's use constituted fair use, but the Federal Circuit again reversed in favor of Oracle in 2018.

The Oracle v. Google lawsuit demonstrated how companies can use intellectual property claims to attack open ecosystems and interoperability. Oracle's pursuit of this case—despite Java's original development by Sun Microsystems with open-source principles—showed how corporate acquisitions can transform the intent and licensing philosophy of foundational technologies. The lawsuit threatened to establish dangerous precedents that would enable corporations to monopolize basic programming interfaces and impede software innovation through copyright claims over functional code elements essential for compatibility.
