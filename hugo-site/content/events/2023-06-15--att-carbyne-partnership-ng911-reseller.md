AT&T announced a strategic partnership with Carbyne enabling the telecommunications giant to resell Carbyne's comprehensive 911 surveillance platform to public safety agencies nationwide, dramatically accelerating deployment of Israeli Unit 8200-developed technology across US emergency communications infrastructure. Under the arrangement, AT&T can resell both Carbyne's data-only Universe offering (supporting real-time video, location tracking, and chat functionalities) and the full APEX product (complete 911 call-taking ecosystem with all surveillance features embedded), with agencies able to deploy systems within one week without extensive upgrades to existing AT&T ESInet platforms.

The partnership emerged after nearly a year of technical integration work between AT&T and Carbyne to support deployments in New Orleans and five Texas agencies using AT&T's ESInet platform. The relationship provided Carbyne with direct access to AT&T's vast network of public safety agency customers, eliminating procurement barriers and enabling rapid scaling of technology developed by veterans of Israel's signals intelligence unit and funded by Jeffrey Epstein, Ehud Barak, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. AT&T's endorsement effectively legitimized Carbyne's surveillance capabilities as standard emergency response infrastructure rather than foreign intelligence-adjacent technology.

The strategic significance extends beyond commercial partnership to systematic integration of Israeli military intelligence capabilities into America's telecommunications backbone. By certifying Carbyne's cloud-native platform for seamless connection to AT&T ESInet (Emergency Services IP Network), the partnership created a privileged pathway for comprehensive data extraction capabilities—smartphone GPS location, live video streaming, text messages, and device data—to flow through national telecommunications infrastructure during every 911 call placed through participating jurisdictions. AT&T Ventures subsequently invested directly in Carbyne in March 2024, deepening the telecommunications giant's financial stake in the Israeli surveillance technology company while Ehud Barak remained chairman and the company maintained its Unit 8200 veteran leadership.

The partnership raised fundamental concerns about technology sovereignty and intelligence access to US emergency communications data. Carbyne's documented connections to Israeli military intelligence (Unit 8200 founders), US intelligence contractors (Peter Thiel's Palantir through Founders Fund investment and Trae Stephens' advisory role), and Epstein's intelligence-linked investment network, combined with AT&T's role as a longtime NSA surveillance partner (exposed through Room 641A and subsequent revelations), created unprecedented integration of foreign and domestic intelligence capabilities into the emergency response infrastructure used by over 250 million Americans. The arrangement allowed rapid deployment "within one week" of comprehensive surveillance systems across dozens of jurisdictions, bypassing more rigorous procurement scrutiny that might have examined the national security implications of embedding Israeli intelligence-developed technology with AT&T's telecommunications infrastructure.
