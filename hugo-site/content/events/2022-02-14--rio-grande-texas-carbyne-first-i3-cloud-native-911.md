Rio Grande Council of Governments (RGCOG) in Texas launched the United States' first i3-compliant cloud-native 911 contact center using Carbyne's APEX platform, deploying across five Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) serving Alpine, Brewster, Presidio, Culberson, and Hudspeth counties in only two and a half days. The $490,000 contract marked the first implementation of i3 technical specifications (NENA's standard for enabling next-generation 911 capabilities) with an ESInet connection in a cloud-native solution, representing a significant milestone in Carbyne's penetration of US emergency response infrastructure.

Carbyne's APEX system provides live video streaming from callers' smartphones, silent instant messaging, text-to-911, IoT data aggregation with automatic transcription, and pinpoint location accuracy within 1 foot even inside buildings. The first deployment went live at Alpine's PSAP on February 14, 2022, with the four remaining locations operational within 60 hours, demonstrating the platform's rapid deployment capability across rural West Texas jurisdictions collectively covering thousands of square miles of the US-Mexico border region.

The deployment's location in remote Texas border counties, combined with Carbyne's documented connections to Israeli military intelligence (Unit 8200 veterans as founders), Ehud Barak's chairmanship, and the company's technology partnerships with AT&T for national ESInet integration, positioned Israeli-developed surveillance technology at a strategic chokepoint for emergency communications infrastructure along the southern US border. The i3 compliance certification and cloud-native architecture enabled interoperability with national Next Generation 911 networks, facilitating Carbyne's subsequent expansion to dozens of additional US jurisdictions and establishing the technical template for the company's comprehensive surveillance capabilities to scale across the national 911 system serving over 250 million people.
