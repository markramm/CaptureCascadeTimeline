On August 1, 1988, just one year after the FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine, Rush Limbaugh launched his radio broadcast into national syndication with 56 radio stations. The show was co-owned and syndicated by Edward F. McLaughlin's EFM Media Management, with McLaughlin being former president of ABC Radio who founded EFM Media in 1988 with Limbaugh's show as his first product.

The timing was not coincidental - the elimination of balanced coverage requirements in 1987 made Limbaugh's unapologetically partisan conservative commentary commercially viable on a national scale. Within three months of launch, the show had expanded to 100 stations. By the mid-1990s, Limbaugh reached over 600 stations and 20+ million listeners, making him the most influential voice in conservative media.

Limbaugh's success demonstrated that partisan political commentary could be both commercially successful and politically powerful. His show provided a daily drumbeat of conservative messaging on cultural and political issues, coordinating talking points across millions of listeners and creating an engaged conservative base that would reliably support Republican candidates and corporate-backed policies.

The show pioneered techniques that would become standard in conservative media: demonization of political opponents, dismissal of mainstream media as "liberal bias," promotion of cultural warfare issues to mobilize voters, and framing of corporate economic interests as aligned with ordinary Americans against elite liberals. Limbaugh was widely credited with resuscitating AM radio, which had been declining before conservative talk radio found its audience.

Limbaugh's rise transformed the conservative movement by creating a direct communication channel between conservative leadership and millions of voters, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers. The success encouraged others and provided the proof of concept for Fox News' 1996 launch, demonstrating that a large, loyal audience existed for partisan conservative media.

The Rush Limbaugh show represented the successful operationalization of conservative media infrastructure, creating echo chambers where corporate-backed political messaging could be delivered without challenge or fact-checking, fundamentally changing how millions of Americans received political information.
