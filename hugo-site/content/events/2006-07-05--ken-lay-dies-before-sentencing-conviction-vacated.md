On July 5, 2006, Kenneth Lay died of a heart attack at his vacation home in Aspen, Colorado, just six weeks after being convicted on all six counts of fraud and conspiracy in the Enron scandal. Lay, 64, was pronounced dead at Aspen Valley Hospital at 3:11 a.m. A preliminary autopsy reported he died of a heart attack caused by coronary artery disease.

Lay had been scheduled for sentencing on October 23, 2006, and faced a potential life sentence for his role in orchestrating Enron's massive accounting fraud that destroyed more than $60 billion in shareholder value. However, because he died before sentencing and before all appeals could be exhausted, Judge Sim Lake vacated Lay's conviction on October 17, 2006, under the legal doctrine of abatement ab initio.

The vacation of Lay's conviction had significant legal and financial consequences. Despite being found guilty by a unanimous jury verdict, Lay's conviction was erased from the legal record, meaning he died with no criminal record. This also complicated efforts by Enron victims to recover assets from Lay's estate, as the government could no longer pursue criminal forfeiture of his wealth.

Lay's death and the subsequent vacation of his conviction highlighted a fundamental flaw in the criminal justice system's ability to hold elite corporate criminals accountable. While Lay enjoyed wealth and privilege until his last day, thousands of Enron employees lost their life savings and retirement security. The legal outcome—combined with Jeffrey Skilling's eventual sentence reduction from 24 to 14 years in 2013—foreshadowed the erosion of accountability that would become complete after the 2008 financial crisis, when no major Wall Street executives faced criminal prosecution at all.
