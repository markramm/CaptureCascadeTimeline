Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell declares the Clinton administration's Health Security Act dead, with the bill never coming to a vote in either chamber of Congress. The failure represents a devastating defeat for comprehensive healthcare reform after an intense lobbying campaign by the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat the legislation. The collapse demonstrates the political power of healthcare industry interests to block reforms that threaten their profit models.

The Health Insurance Association of America produced highly effective "Harry and Louise" television advertisements featuring a married couple discussing their frustrations with features of the Health Security Act, successfully turning public opinion against the plan. The ads, combined with organized opposition from health care organizations, the health insurance industry, and the right wing of the Republican Party, proved insurmountable. First Lady Hillary Clinton, who chaired the task force developing the plan, became a target of the industry campaign, with her popularity considerably diminished by the barrage from pharmaceutical and health insurance industries.

The plan's failure stemmed from multiple factors: its large scope made it difficult to explain to Congress and the public; there was little effort to gain bipartisan support; and Congressional Democrats were divided, pushing their own favored solutions rather than endorsing the Clinton plan. The defeat exemplifies industry capture of the healthcare policy process, where insurance and pharmaceutical companies successfully deployed their lobbying resources to prevent reforms that would have expanded coverage and controlled costs, preserving their ability to profit from the existing system at the expense of millions of uninsured Americans.
