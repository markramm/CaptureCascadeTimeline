Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North is convicted on May 4, 1989, of three felony charges stemming from his central role in the Iran-Contra scandal: accepting an illegal gratuity (a security fence for his home), aiding and abetting in the obstruction of a congressional inquiry, and ordering the destruction of documents through his secretary Fawn Hall. U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell sentences North on July 5, 1989, to a three-year suspended prison term, two years probation, $150,000 in fines, and 1,200 hours of community service.

The conviction represents a rare moment of accountability for Iran-Contra, finding North criminally liable for his role in running the illegal shadow operation that sold arms to Iran and diverted proceeds to Nicaraguan Contra rebels in violation of the Boland Amendment. North's systematic destruction of NSC documents in November 1986 and his admitted lies to Congress demonstrate a deliberate pattern of obstruction designed to conceal illegal activities from democratic oversight.

However, on July 20, 1990, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacates all three convictions, ruling that the government violated North's Fifth Amendment rights by granting him limited immunity to testify before Congress in 1987, then prosecuting him without properly ensuring that trial witnesses were not influenced by his immunized congressional testimony. The appeals court determines that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh failed to establish an adequate "firewall" between North's immunized testimony and the criminal trial.

On September 16, 1991, Judge Gesell dismisses the case entirely after hearings confirm the immunity contamination issue. The Supreme Court declines to review the case, allowing North to escape all criminal accountability. This outcome establishes a perverse precedent: congressional grants of immunity designed to uncover truth can inadvertently shield wrongdoers from prosecution, creating a system where officials can confess to crimes on television with immunity and then avoid conviction because their public admissions contaminated the trial process.
