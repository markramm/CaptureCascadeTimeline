On October 30, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, fundamentally deregulating the cable television industry and setting the stage for massive media consolidation. Written and championed by conservative Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the act amended the Communications Act of 1934 with a new Title VI governing cable communications.

The legislation freed cable companies from federal price controls and rate regulation, gave them renewal expectancy for franchise agreements, and allowed them to default on previous promises in certain circumstances. Local governments were given nominal oversight of cable franchise agreements, but the act represented a major victory for cable corporations over broadcasters and telephone companies.

The Cable Act was part of the broader Reagan administration's deregulation agenda, with the FCC changing course during Reagan's presidency to become what critics called a "conduit for deregulation" of both common carriers and broadcast media. This represented abandonment of the public interest standard that had previously governed media regulation.

The deregulation enabled by the 1984 Act laid groundwork for future media consolidation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 would further relax cross-ownership limits, allowing telephone companies to enter cable markets and encouraging mergers and buyouts that concentrated media ownership in fewer corporate hands.

The Cable Communications Policy Act was significant for the emerging conservative media infrastructure. By deregulating cable television and enabling corporate consolidation, the Act helped create conditions where conservative media outlets like Fox News (launched in 1996) could achieve national reach through cable systems, bypassing the broadcast standards and Fairness Doctrine requirements that still nominally applied to over-the-air television.

The 1984 deregulation of cable represented another component of systematic infrastructure building during the 1970s-1980s foundation period. While conservative think tanks developed policy, the Federalist Society built judicial pipelines, and direct mail operations mobilized donors, the Cable Act helped ensure that corporate-controlled media could deliver coordinated conservative messaging to millions of American homes without government oversight or public interest obligations.
