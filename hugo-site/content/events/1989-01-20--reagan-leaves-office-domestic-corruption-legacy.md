Ronald Reagan leaves office with a domestic legacy of systematic corruption, regulatory capture, and policy failures that define American political economy for decades. The S&L crisis triggered by his deregulation will ultimately cost taxpayers $160 billion and require prosecuting 1,000+ bankers for fraud. His EPA and Interior Department faced unprecedented scandals, with Anne Gorsuch becoming the first cabinet official held in contempt of Congress and Rita Lavelle convicted of perjury. His AIDS policy consisted of eight years of deadly silence while over 100,000 Americans died, with the epidemic exploding due to deliberate federal inaction. His union-busting beginning with PATCO destroyed labor's bargaining power, initiating four decades of wage stagnation despite productivity growth.

Reagan's economic policies systematically redistributed wealth upward through massive tax cuts for the wealthy that tripled the national debt while failing to deliver promised growth. Supply-side "trickle-down" economics proved empirically false, but successfully transferred trillions to the wealthy while middle-class incomes stagnated. Corporate tax avoidance exploded through loopholes Reagan created, shifting fiscal burden onto working families. Wealth inequality accelerated to levels unseen since the Gilded Age, with the top 1% capturing ever-larger shares of national income. The "Reagan Revolution" wasn't revolution but restoration: restoring plutocratic control over economy and politics through coordinated dismantling of New Deal protections.

The Reagan legacy establishes templates for future Republican governance: explode deficits through tax cuts for the wealthy, appoint industry representatives to regulatory agencies, weaken enforcement of corporate accountability, destroy labor unions, prioritize evangelical ideology over public health, and abandon agencies when scandals erupt. His presidency proves that systematic corruption and policy failure can be politically successful when wrapped in optimistic rhetoric and culture war appeals. The institutional damage—weakened regulatory capacity, normalized inequality, destroyed labor power, structural moral hazard in finance—persists for generations. Reagan didn't restore American greatness, he inaugurated American decline through policies serving oligarchic interests over public welfare.
