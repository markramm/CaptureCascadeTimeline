The Tower Commission delivers its report on the Iran-Contra affair to President Reagan, producing findings widely criticized as a whitewash that shields Reagan from accountability while blaming subordinates for the illegal scheme. The commission, composed of former Senator John Tower, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, concludes that Reagan "clearly didn't understand the nature of this operation" and faults his "lax management" rather than deliberate wrongdoing.

The report determines that Reagan approved arms sales to Iran hoping to free American hostages in Lebanon, but claims he lacked knowledge of the diversion of funds to the Contras. This conclusion strains credulity given the extensive NSC involvement and Reagan's documented policy preferences. The commission criticizes CIA Director William Casey for failing to properly notify the president and Congress, and faults NSC staff Oliver North and John Poindexter for usurping the CIA's role in conducting covert operations.

Critically, the Tower Commission has no powers to subpoena documents, compel testimony, or grant immunity from prosecution, severely limiting its investigative capacity. The report reveals that Admiral Poindexter deleted approximately 5,000 NSC emails and that North destroyed extensive documentation, yet the commission's limited mandate prevents thorough investigation of this obstruction.

Later revelations expose potential conflicts of interest: Senator Tower never discloses his relationship with CIA arms trafficker Samuel Cummings (Tower's brother-in-law) or calls him to testify publicly, raising questions about the commission's independence. Critics allege the commission was designed as a limited-hangout operation to protect Reagan while sacrificing lower-level officials, setting a precedent for future executive accountability failures.
