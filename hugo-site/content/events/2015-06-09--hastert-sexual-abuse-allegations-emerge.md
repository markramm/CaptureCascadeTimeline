title: "Sexual Abuse Allegations Against Dennis Hastert Publicly Emerge"
summary: |
  Sexual abuse allegations against former House Speaker Dennis Hastert became public when Jolene Reinboldt Burdge revealed on ABC News' Good Morning America that her deceased brother, Steve Reinboldt, had told her in 1979 that he was sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years at Yorkville High School in the early 1970s. Burdge's statements marked the first time a victim had been publicly identified in connection with Hastert's indictment for bank fraud and lying to the FBI.

  Burdge explained that her brother, who died of AIDS in 1995, confided in her eight years after his 1971 graduation that Hastert had molested him while serving as the school's wrestling coach. The Los Angeles Times reported that federal investigators had spoken with another former student who made similar allegations that corroborated the first victim's account. Two people briefed on the evidence stated that Hastert had paid $1.7 million out of a promised $3.5 million to one victim, referred to in court documents as "Individual A."

  The revelations transformed public understanding of Hastert's May 2015 indictment from a banking crime into a cover-up of decades-old child sexual abuse. Federal prosecutors would later allege that Hastert molested at least four boys as young as 14 years old during his time as a high school wrestling coach from the late 1960s through the 1970s. The case exposed how one of America's most powerful politicians—who was third in line to the presidency and the longest-serving Republican House Speaker—had been paying millions to conceal his past as a serial child molester.
