Metro Emergency Communications in Utah County went live with Carbyne's Universe platform on August 28, 2023, deploying AI-powered emergency response technology across Provo, Orem, and Lindon that provides 911 call takers with precise GPS location data, live video streaming from caller smartphones, text chat capabilities, and real-time information sharing with field responders. The Over-The-Top (OTT) Next Generation 9-1-1 system collects and integrates comprehensive multimedia data from emergency callers, moving beyond legacy voice-only 911 technology to create what Carbyne describes as a "holistic, immersive view of an incident."

Manager Heather Perkins reported immediate operational value, citing cases where video confirmed the size and location of a brush fire in the foothills to determine appropriate response levels, and GPS location data revealed inaccurate caller information to potentially prevent false reports. The Responder Connect feature enables field personnel to share real-time information back to dispatch, creating continuous data flows between callers, dispatchers, and responding units throughout emergency incidents.

The Utah deployment demonstrated Carbyne's systematic penetration of US municipal emergency services following the company's strategic AT&T partnership announced three months earlier in June 2023. The AI-powered platform developed by Israeli Unit 8200 intelligence veterans and funded by Ehud Barak, Jeffrey Epstein, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund continued expanding comprehensive surveillance capabilities across American communities, with Utah County's adoption adding to dozens of jurisdictions collectively serving over 250 million people with technology that extracts smartphone location, video, text, and device data during every 911 call—capabilities nominally serving public safety purposes but operated by a company maintaining documented connections to Israeli military intelligence, US intelligence contractors, and international business interests spanning multiple countries and intelligence services.
