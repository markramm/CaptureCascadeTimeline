By mid-Reagan presidency, the structural mechanisms of permanent upward wealth redistribution are firmly established: union-busting destroys worker bargaining power, tax policy rewards capital over labor, financial deregulation enables speculation and asset stripping, and weakened antitrust enforcement allows corporate consolidation. The combination ensures that productivity gains flow to shareholders and executives rather than workers, establishing a four-decade pattern where GDP growth no longer improves living standards for working families. "Trickle-down economics" proves to be trickle-up in practice: wealth concentrates at the top while middle-class purchasing power stagnates.

The Reagan revolution successfully restructures American capitalism to favor capital owners over workers through coordinated policy changes: tax cuts reduce top marginal rates by over 50 percentage points while payroll taxes increase on workers; deregulation allows corporations to externalize costs onto workers and communities; privatization transfers public assets to private profit; and globalization without worker protections enables capital mobility while constraining labor power. These aren't isolated policies but systematic transformation of political economy to benefit the wealthy, justified by debunked "trickle-down" theory that claims benefits will eventually reach workers.

The long-term consequences define American economic reality for generations: two-income families become necessity rather than choice as single-earner households can't maintain middle-class status; consumer debt explodes as wage stagnation forces borrowing to maintain living standards; wealth inequality reaches levels unseen since the Gilded Age; and social mobility declines as concentrated wealth purchases political power to preserve advantages. Reagan's "revolution" isn't temporary policy shift but permanent structural change: American capitalism no longer generates shared prosperity but systematic extraction, with working families' wealth transferred upward through wages that don't keep pace with productivity, housing costs, healthcare, and education.
