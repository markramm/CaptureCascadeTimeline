title: "Congress Quietly Guts STOCK Act Online Disclosure Requirements"
summary: |
  President Obama signed legislation that gutted key provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, just one year after the law was passed with great fanfare to combat congressional insider trading. The amendment eliminated the requirement for creating a searchable, sortable online database of financial disclosure information and removed the mandate that reports be filed electronically rather than on paper. The changes drastically reduced transparency by limiting mandatory public online reporting to only Members of Congress, congressional candidates, the President, Vice President, and top executive branch officials—excluding approximately 28,000 high-level federal employees who were previously covered.

  The bill passed through the Senate and House using unanimous consent in largely empty chambers during a fast-track procedure, with minimal debate or public notice. When President Obama signed the bill, the White House announcement was a single sentence long—a stark contrast to the April 2012 signing ceremony for the original STOCK Act, which featured a high-profile East Room event with extensive media coverage. Congress cited vague "security" concerns about posting financial data online, though critics noted the real concern was public scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest.

  The gutting of the STOCK Act exemplified Congress's pattern of passing popular anti-corruption legislation under public pressure, then quietly dismantling enforcement mechanisms once media attention faded. NPR noted: "How Congress Quietly Overhauled Its Insider-Trading Law." The changes severely limited the public's ability to monitor potential insider trading and conflicts of interest among government officials and their staff, effectively neutering one of the Obama era's signature ethics reforms while maintaining the facade that restrictions remained in place.
