title: Ring launches Neighbors app creating crowdsourced surveillance network
---

Ring launched its standalone Neighbors app on iOS and Android devices, marking its first major product release since Amazon's acquisition two months earlier. The free app allows users to share photos and videos of alleged suspicious activity, creating a crowdsourced surveillance network connecting Ring doorbell owners and non-owners within geographic areas.

## Platform Design and Functionality

The Neighbors app enables users to post and view real-time crime and safety alerts within their neighborhoods, share footage captured by Ring cameras, and communicate about perceived threats. The platform was designed to connect people in nearby areas to collectively monitor and report on community activity, effectively creating a privatized neighborhood watch system backed by Amazon's infrastructure.

## Privacy and Discrimination Concerns

Civil rights advocacy groups immediately criticized the app for facilitating racial profiling and discriminatory reporting. The Electronic Frontier Foundation warned that platforms like Neighbors "facilitate reporting of so-called 'suspicious' behavior that really amounts to racial profiling." Fight for the Future characterized the app as building "a private surveillance network backed by law enforcement agencies," presaging the controversial police partnerships that would rapidly expand in subsequent years.

## Foundation for Police Integration

The app included infrastructure allowing law enforcement agencies to create verified accounts and make public posts, establishing the technical foundation for Ring's controversial police partnership program that would launch police access to the platform within months.
