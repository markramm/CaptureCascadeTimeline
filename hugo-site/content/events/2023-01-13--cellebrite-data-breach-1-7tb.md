An anonymous whistleblower provides 1.7 terabytes of stolen Cellebrite data to hacktivist collective Enlace Hacktivista, representing one of the largest breaches in the surveillance technology industry. The massive leak includes the entire Cellebrite suite of programs, including the company's flagship Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) software, Physical Analyzer, Physical Analyzer Ultra, Cellebrite Reader, license management tools, and extensive technical documentation. The breach exposes the inner workings of tools used by law enforcement agencies worldwide to crack encrypted phones and extract data, potentially enabling security researchers to identify vulnerabilities in Cellebrite's products and develop countermeasures. The leak also raises serious questions about Cellebrite's security practices, as a company selling surveillance tools to governments and intelligence agencies proves unable to secure its own sensitive software and documentation. This represents the third major data breach affecting Cellebrite since 2017, following the 900 GB breach in January 2017 and a 4 TB leak in August 2021, establishing a pattern of security failures at a company whose business model depends on maintaining the secrecy of its phone-cracking techniques. The breach provides transparency advocates and privacy researchers with unprecedented insight into mobile device forensics capabilities deployed by law enforcement, though Cellebrite characterizes its severity differently than independent security analysts.
