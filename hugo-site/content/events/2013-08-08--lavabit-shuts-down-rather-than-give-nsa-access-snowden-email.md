Lavabit, an encrypted email service used by Edward Snowden, abruptly shut down rather than comply with federal government demands for the company's SSL encryption keys, which would have compromised the privacy of all 400,000 users. Founder Ladar Levison announced the closure with a cryptic message: "I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit."

The FBI had targeted Lavabit immediately after Snowden revealed himself as the source of NSA leaks in June 2013, demanding access to Snowden's email account at Ed_Snowden@lavabit.com. When Levison resisted providing targeted access, the Justice Department obtained a search warrant demanding that Lavabit turn over its master SSL private keys, which would give the government the ability to decrypt and monitor all Lavabit email traffic in real-time, not just Snowden's communications.

The demand placed Levison in an impossible position: either betray the fundamental privacy promise made to all Lavabit users by turning over encryption keys that would compromise every account, or shut down the service entirely. Levison initially attempted a form of malicious compliance by providing the 2,560-character SSL key printed in 4-point font on paper, making it practically unusable. The government responded by threatening Levison with arrest for contempt and imposing $10,000 in daily fines until he provided the keys in electronic format.

Rather than comply, Levison chose to destroy his own business, shutting down Lavabit permanently on August 8, 2013. He was subsequently summoned before a grand jury, fined $10,000 for his initial resistance, and placed under a gag order that prevented him from publicly explaining the government's demands. The case revealed the extreme measures the surveillance state was willing to employ: rather than seek a targeted warrant for one user's communications, the FBI demanded total access to an entire service, demonstrating that national security investigations could justify unlimited collateral surveillance of innocent users.

The Lavabit shutdown served as a stark warning to other privacy-focused tech companies about the consequences of resisting surveillance demands, while simultaneously inspiring a new generation of end-to-end encrypted services designed to be technically unable to comply with such orders.
