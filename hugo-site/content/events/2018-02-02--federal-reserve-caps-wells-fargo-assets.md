The Federal Reserve Board imposes an unprecedented enforcement action against Wells Fargo, restricting the bank from growing beyond its total asset size as of December 31, 2017—approximately $1.95 trillion. The asset cap represents the most severe punishment the Fed has imposed on a major bank in modern times, effectively freezing Wells Fargo's ability to expand until it demonstrates substantial improvements in governance, risk management, and compliance. The Fed also requires Wells Fargo to replace four board members and subjects all directors to unprecedented supervisory letters noting they "did not meet supervisory expectations."

## Historic Regulatory Action

Fed Chair Janet Yellen states the restriction "will remain in place until the firm has sufficiently improved its governance and controls." The asset cap is extraordinary: Wells Fargo cannot grow larger, regardless of market conditions, business opportunities, or competitive pressures, until regulators approve. For a bank accustomed to growth and expansion, the cap functions as regulatory handcuffs. The Fed estimates the restriction will cost Wells Fargo billions in foregone profits and market share—a far more meaningful penalty than the $185 million fine from 2016.

## Board Accountability

The Fed requires Wells Fargo to replace three directors by April 2018 and one additional director by year-end 2018. More significantly, all current board members must sign the cease and desist order, and each receives a letter from the Fed stating they failed to meet supervisory expectations during the period of "pervasive and persistent misconduct." This direct censure of board members is virtually unprecedented, acknowledging that corporate governance failures enabled systematic fraud.

## Requirements for Lifting the Cap

To have the asset cap removed, Wells Fargo must demonstrate it has implemented "an effective firm-wide risk management framework" covering all significant risks, improved board oversight, and addressed the compliance breakdowns that allowed fraud to persist. The Fed makes clear that superficial changes will not suffice—the bank must fundamentally reform its culture, governance, and controls. The Fed retains sole discretion to determine when improvements are sufficient.

## Significance

The asset cap represents the most severe regulatory punishment imposed on a major American bank since the 2008 financial crisis—arguably more consequential than the crisis-era penalties which largely consisted of fines paid by shareholders. By restricting growth, the Fed imposes ongoing costs that directly impact Wells Fargo's competitiveness, market value, and management flexibility. The cap will remain in place for over seven years (until 2025), costing an estimated $39 billion in foregone profits according to Bloomberg analysis.

Yet even this unprecedented action has limitations. The asset cap does not require Wells Fargo to shrink, break up, or exit lines of business. It does not result in criminal prosecutions of executives. It does not prevent the bank from remaining profitable or board members from retaining their wealth. Most importantly, it comes two years after the fraud was exposed and six years after senior executives were aware of systematic misconduct. The punishment, while severe by regulatory standards, still treats Wells Fargo's admitted fraud of millions of customers as a civil compliance matter rather than criminal enterprise. The message: even the Fed's most aggressive action stops short of treating banking fraud as serious crime.
