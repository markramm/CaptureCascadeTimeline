Anduril Industries selected Columbus, Ohio for Arsenal-1, its first 'hyperscale manufacturing facility' designed to produce tens of thousands of autonomous weapons systems annually. The company announced nearly $1 billion in investment to build the 5-million-square-foot facility in Pickaway County, creating 4,008 jobs by 2035 in Ohio's largest single job-creation project in state history. Production is scheduled to begin in July 2026, manufacturing Anduril's Fury autonomous fighter jet, Roadrunner drone interceptor, and Barracuda munitions. The facility represents industrialization of AI-powered weapons at unprecedented scale, with Anduril explicitly positioning Arsenal-1 as infrastructure to 'hyperscale' autonomous systems production for the Pentagon. The $1 billion investment comes from Anduril's August 2024 Series F funding round that raised $1.5 billion, demonstrating venture capital's bet on autonomous warfare manufacturing. The rapid timeline—from announcement to production in under two years—exemplifies Silicon Valley's 'move fast' ethos applied to lethal autonomous weapons.
