Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger is indicted by a federal grand jury on five felony counts of lying to Congress and investigators about the Iran-Contra scandal, marking the highest-ranking Reagan administration official charged in the affair. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh brings the indictment one day before the statute of limitations expires on two counts, charging Weinberger with perjury and concealing more than 1,700 pages of notes from a personal diary documenting discussions with other officials about arms sales to Iran.

The five felony counts charge Weinberger with: (1) obstruction of a congressional investigation by concealing and withholding relevant notes; (2) making false statements to Congress regarding his knowledge of Saudi Arabia's funding of the Contras; (3) perjury during July 31, 1987 testimony about his knowledge of the November 1985 weapons shipment; (4) perjury about his knowledge of the need to resupply Israel with TOW missiles delivered to Tehran in August and September 1985; and (5) additional false statements to investigators.

Weinberger's personal notes contradict his sworn testimony and reveal extensive knowledge of the illegal arms-for-hostages scheme at the highest levels of the Reagan administration. The notes document internal discussions about circumventing congressional prohibitions and provide evidence that senior officials, including Vice President George H.W. Bush, were far more involved in Iran-Contra operations than publicly acknowledged.

Weinberger pleads not guilty to all charges on June 19, 1992. However, he never faces trial because President Bush pardons him on December 24, 1992—twelve days before Weinberger's trial was scheduled to begin. The pardon prevents public disclosure of Weinberger's notes in court, which could have implicated Bush himself in the scandal. Independent counsel Walsh condemns the pardon as completing the Iran-Contra cover-up.
