The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act implements strict work requirements mandating that welfare recipients must work or participate in work-related activities after receiving assistance for two years. The law includes "strong work requirements" and a "performance bonus to reward states for moving welfare recipients into jobs," fundamentally redefining welfare as a temporary transition to employment rather than ongoing support for families in need.

The legislation requires states to meet participation rate targets: 50 percent of all families and 90 percent of two-parent families must be engaged in work activities, or states face financial penalties. Qualifying work activities include unsubsidized employment, subsidized private or public sector employment, work experience, on-the-job training, job search and job readiness assistance (limited to six weeks), community service programs, and vocational educational training (limited to 12 months).

While the law includes increased funding for childcare ($14 billion over six years) and guarantees of continued Medicaid coverage to support the transition to work, critics argue these supports are insufficient to overcome barriers to employment such as lack of transportation, childcare costs, limited education, or health problems. The work requirements do not account for local labor market conditions, availability of jobs paying livable wages, or discrimination in hiring. The policy effectively creates a pool of workers compelled to accept low-wage employment regardless of working conditions, potentially depressing wages and strengthening employer leverage over vulnerable workers.
