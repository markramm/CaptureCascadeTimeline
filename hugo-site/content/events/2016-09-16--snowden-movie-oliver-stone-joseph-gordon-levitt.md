Director Oliver Stone's biographical thriller "Snowden" was released in U.S. theaters, bringing Edward Snowden's story to mainstream audiences through a Hollywood dramatization starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the NSA whistleblower. The film chronicled Snowden's journey from his early career as a CIA technician through his work as an NSA contractor at Booz Allen Hamilton to his decision to leak classified documents exposing mass surveillance programs, culminating in his 2013 Hong Kong meeting with journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras.

The film featured an ensemble cast including Shailene Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend Lindsay Mills, Melissa Leo as Laura Poitras, Zachary Quinto as Glenn Greenwald, and Nicolas Cage as a disillusioned NSA veteran. Stone's screenplay, co-written with Kieran Fitzgerald, was based partly on Luke Harding's book "The Snowden Files" and Anatoly Kucherena's novel "Time of the Octopus," as well as extensive interviews with Snowden himself in Moscow. The film received mixed critical reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 61% approval rating based on 257 reviews.

The theatrical release came at a politically significant moment, as privacy advocates and civil liberties groups continued to press for Snowden's pardon. The film ended with a powerful cameo appearance by the real Edward Snowden via video link, emphasizing the ongoing nature of his exile in Russia. By presenting Snowden's story in a mainstream Hollywood format, the film aimed to reach audiences beyond those who had followed the technical details of NSA surveillance programs through journalism and documentaries.

However, the movie underperformed at the box office, grossing only $37.3 million worldwide against its $40 million budget, suggesting that mainstream American audiences remained divided or disinterested in Snowden's story three years after his revelations. Critics noted that Stone's typically bold directorial style was somewhat muted, with the film playing it safer than his earlier controversial political dramas. Nonetheless, the film contributed to keeping Snowden's case in the public eye and introduced his story to viewers who might not have engaged with documentary treatments like Laura Poitras's Oscar-winning "Citizenfour" (2014).
