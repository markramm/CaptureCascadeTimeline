Hours before leaving office, President Bill Clinton grants a controversial presidential pardon to Marc Rich, an international fugitive who fled to Switzerland in 1983 to avoid prosecution on 51 counts of tax fraud, racketeering, and illegal oil trading with Iran during the 1979-1980 hostage crisis. Rich was indicted for evading more than $48 million in taxes and conducting illegal business deals worth an estimated $200 million. The pardon raises immediate corruption concerns due to substantial political donations from Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich.

Denise Rich, a Democratic political fundraiser, donated more than $1 million to Democratic causes during Clinton's presidency, including more than $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation. Rich also donated $70,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign and made substantial contributions to the Democratic National Committee. The timing and circumstances led to widespread allegations that the pardon was effectively purchased through political donations.

Federal prosecutors Mary Jo White and later Republican James Comey investigated the pardon but found no evidence of criminal activity. However, the pardon triggered Congressional hearings and remains one of the most controversial in presidential history, earning the nickname "Pardongate." The case exemplifies concerns about the intersection of political fundraising, personal enrichment, and the exercise of presidential pardon power without accountability or transparency in the final hours of an administration.
