title: "Rep. Duncan Hunter Pleads Guilty to Stealing Campaign Funds After Blaming Wife"
summary: |
  U.S. Representative Duncan D. Hunter pleaded guilty in federal court in San Diego to one count of conspiracy to misuse campaign funds, admitting that he and his wife knowingly and willfully stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to maintain their lifestyle. The guilty plea came after Hunter had spent over a year denying wrongdoing, claiming the prosecution was a political "witch hunt," and publicly attempting to shift blame onto his wife Margaret, who had already pleaded guilty in June 2019.

  Hunter admitted that he and Margaret illegally converted more than $150,000 in campaign funds between 2010 and 2016, engaging in "30 or more illegal transactions." Prosecutors detailed that the Hunters stole campaign money for items "as inconsequential as fast food, movie tickets and sneakers; as trivial as video games, Lego sets and Playdoh; as mundane as groceries, dog food, and utilities; and as self-indulgent as luxury hotels and overseas vacations," including a 2015 Italy trip costing over $14,000.

  The guilty plea was particularly significant as Hunter was the second House member to endorse Donald Trump in 2016, after Chris Collins. Both early Trump supporters pleaded guilty to criminal charges despite claiming their prosecutions were politically motivated. Hunter's sentencing was scheduled for March 2020, facing a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. He was ultimately sentenced to 11 months in prison but was later pardoned by President Trump in December 2020, exemplifying Trump's pattern of pardoning corrupt allies.
