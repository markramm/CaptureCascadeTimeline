Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing titled "An Examination of Wells Fargo's Unauthorized Accounts and the Regulatory Response." Senator Elizabeth Warren delivers a devastating confrontation, accusing Stumpf of "gutless leadership" and demanding his resignation, return of compensation earned during the fraud, and criminal investigation. The hearing becomes an iconic moment exposing the disconnect between executive accountability rhetoric and reality.

## Warren's Cross-Examination

Warren systematically dismantles Stumpf's defenses. She challenges his claim that cross-selling deepened customer relationships, presenting evidence that he held 6.75 million shares that appreciated by roughly $30 during the scandal, netting him over $200 million in personal gains "thanks in part to those cross-sell numbers that you talked about on every one of those calls." When Stumpf claims the fraud was committed by bad actors, Warren responds: "If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawer, they'd probably be looking at criminal charges for theft."

Warren's key demand: "You should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission." She notes that Stumpf has not resigned, returned any compensation, or fired any senior executives, only low-level workers.

## Bipartisan Outrage

Warren is far from alone. Republican and Democratic senators unite in condemning the bank's practices. Senator Jon Tester notes that Stumpf has achieved something unprecedented: "You have done something that's never happened and united this committee on a major topic... and not in a good way." The two-hour grilling reveals universal frustration with a accountability system that punishes workers while protecting executives.

## Stumpf's Defense Crumbles

Stumpf attempts to maintain that the 5,300 fired employees were individual bad actors, not responding to institutional pressure. He defends Wells Fargo's sales culture and insists senior management bears no responsibility. The testimony fails to satisfy any senator. His refusal to accept personal accountability or acknowledge systemic problems deepens the scandal's political impact.

## Significance

The hearing becomes a defining moment in public awareness of executive impunity. Warren's confrontation crystalizes the fundamental injustice: 5,300 workers fired and facing potential prosecution, while executives who designed the fraud-incentivizing system keep their jobs and hundreds of millions in compensation. The viral clips of Warren's "you should resign" demand make her a hero to millions frustrated by two-tiered justice. Yet despite the dramatic testimony, Stumpf will resign weeks later with over $130 million, no criminal charges will be filed against any executive, and the DOJ will eventually decline prosecution. The hearing exposes the problem but proves powerless to solve it.
