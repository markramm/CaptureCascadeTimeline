The national debt under President Reagan explodes from $997 billion in 1981 to $2.9 trillion by 1989, representing an increase of 186% and adding approximately $1.9 trillion in new debt during his eight-year presidency. Annual budget deficits average 4.0% of GDP during Reagan's tenure, compared to 2.2% during the previous eight years, with deficits never falling below $153 billion between 1983-1989 and reaching $221 billion in 1986. The debt explosion directly contradicts supply-side economic theory, which promised that tax cuts would generate enough economic growth to offset revenue losses and balance the budget.

The deficit catastrophe stems from Reagan's 1981 tax cuts reducing federal revenue by an estimated $2 trillion between 1982-1991, combined with massive increases in defense spending that rise from $157 billion in 1981 to $304 billion in 1989. Supply-side proponents like Arthur Laffer claimed tax cuts would be self-financing through economic growth, but reality proves otherwise: even with significant GDP growth during the 1980s, federal revenue as percentage of GDP declines while spending increases, producing record peacetime deficits. The public debt held by the federal government nearly triples in nominal terms from $738 billion to $2.1 trillion.

Reagan's deficit explosion has lasting consequences for American fiscal policy. The debt burden constrains future government investment in infrastructure, education, and social programs as interest payments consume growing portions of the federal budget. Despite campaigning as a fiscal conservative who would balance the budget, Reagan instead inaugurates four decades of Republican deficit hypocrisy: massive tax cuts for the wealthy combined with increased military spending, with deficits blamed on social programs that are actually cut. The Reagan debt explosion establishes the modern Republican fiscal pattern: explode deficits through tax cuts while in power, then demand austerity and social spending cuts when Democrats take office.
