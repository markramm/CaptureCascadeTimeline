The Telecommunications Act of 1996's media consolidation provisions trigger massive job losses across American journalism, gutting local news coverage and professional media employment. In radio alone, cities that once had 100 jobs for radio professionals now have perhaps 20, an 80% reduction in employment. USA Today, the nation's largest circulation newspaper, experiences layoffs described as a "total bloodbath" in the American Journalism Review.

The consolidation wave reduces the number of major media content companies from about 50 in 1983 to just 10 by 1996, and only 6 by 2005, while simultaneously eliminating tens of thousands of journalism jobs. An FCC study confirms a "drastic decline in the number of radio station owners" even as the actual number of stations increases - fewer owners control more properties with far fewer staff. Consolidated media companies systematically eliminate local programming and news coverage to maximize profits through cost-cutting.

The destruction of local journalism has profound implications for democratic governance. Communities lose coverage of local government, school boards, zoning decisions, and municipal corruption. Consolidated media corporations replace local news with cheaper syndicated national programming, creating "news deserts" where citizens have no access to information about their own communities. The job losses also devastate a generation of journalism professionals, destroying career paths and institutional knowledge. The Telecommunications Act's promise to "enhance media quality and diversity" proves completely false - instead, consumers experience rising cable and phone rates while journalism employment collapses and local news disappears, demonstrating how deregulation marketed as pro-consumer actually serves only corporate profit maximization.
