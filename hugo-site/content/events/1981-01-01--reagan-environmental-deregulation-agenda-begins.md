The Reagan administration launches systematic dismantling of environmental protections through regulatory capture: appointing industry advocates to lead EPA and Interior, slashing enforcement budgets, weakening Clean Air and Water Act regulations, and opening public lands to resource extraction. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch cuts the agency's budget by 22%, reduces enforcement cases against polluters, and prioritizes industry convenience over public health. Interior Secretary James Watt accelerates oil, gas, and coal leasing on federal lands while attempting to sell off national parks and wilderness areas, openly stating his goal is reducing federal environmental protection to benefit extractive industries.

The deregulation agenda reflects ideological conviction that environmental protection represents government overreach harming business. Reagan's appointees systematically weaken enforcement: toxic waste cleanups are delayed, air and water quality standards are relaxed, pesticide restrictions are lifted, and career scientists who object face retaliation. The Superfund program becomes a political tool, with cleanup priorities manipulated to benefit Republican congressional candidates. Public lands policy shifts from conservation to extraction, with Watt's Interior Department viewing wilderness protection as obstacle to corporate profit rather than public trust responsibility.

The environmental deregulation produces immediate public health consequences: toxic waste sites proliferate, air and water quality deteriorate in industrial areas, and pesticide-related illnesses increase among farmworkers and rural communities. The scandals eventually force resignations of both Gorsuch and Watt, but the damage persists: weakened enforcement capacity, depleted agency expertise, and normalized industry capture of regulatory agencies. The Reagan environmental record establishes the Republican anti-regulatory template: claim regulations "kill jobs," appoint industry representatives to regulatory positions, defund enforcement, and abandon agencies when scandals erupt. The precedent enables future assaults on environmental protection, culminating in Trump-era regulatory destruction.
