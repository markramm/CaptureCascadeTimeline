President Trump ordered the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from her post in Ukraine on April 24, 2019, with her recall becoming public on May 7, following a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, and Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat with 33 years of service and a reputation for fighting corruption, became a target because her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine threatened to expose the scheme Giuliani was orchestrating to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden. The State Department later characterized Lutsenko's allegations against Yovanovitch as "an outright fabrication" and a "classic disinformation campaign," but Trump nevertheless removed one of America's most distinguished diplomats to clear the path for his shadow diplomacy operation.

## The Smear Campaign

Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general who was himself the subject of corruption allegations, accused Yovanovitch of giving him a "do not prosecute" list and interfering in his ability to combat corruption in Ukraine. These fabricated allegations were amplified by Rudy Giuliani and conservative commentator John Solomon of The Hill, who published a series of articles attacking Yovanovitch based on Lutsenko's false claims. The New York Times reported that Lutsenko met with Giuliani multiple times in New York, coordinating the campaign against Yovanovitch. Giuliani's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman—who would later be indicted for campaign finance violations—worked with Lutsenko to orchestrate the smear campaign and pressure Trump to remove Yovanovitch from her post.

## Trump's Removal Order

Trump ordered Yovanovitch's recall on April 24, 2019, after sustained pressure from Giuliani and other allies who claimed she was undermining efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Yovanovitch later testified that she was informed "there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018." She returned to Washington on April 25, 2019, and her mission as ambassador was officially terminated on May 20, 2019. Democratic lawmakers condemned the recall as a "political hit job," noting that Yovanovitch was being punished for doing her job fighting corruption.

## Purpose: Clearing the Path for Shadow Diplomacy

Yovanovitch's removal was essential to Trump and Giuliani's scheme to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations of Biden. As a career diplomat committed to official channels and anti-corruption efforts, Yovanovitch posed an obstacle to the irregular "shadow diplomacy" operation Giuliani was conducting with Parnas, Fruman, and complicit Ukrainian officials. Her testimony would later detail how Giuliani and his associates worked to "circumvent official channels" of Ukraine policy, using corrupt prosecutors and fabricated allegations to remove the ambassador who would have reported their scheme through proper diplomatic channels.

## Significance

The removal of Marie Yovanovitch represented the systematic corruption of American foreign policy to serve Trump's personal political interests. By orchestrating a smear campaign based on fabrications from a corrupt foreign prosecutor, then removing a distinguished career diplomat to clear the path for shadow diplomacy, Trump demonstrated his willingness to destroy professional civil servants who stood in the way of his corruption. Yovanovitch's removal was a prerequisite for the July 25, 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky and the broader Ukraine extortion scheme that would lead to Trump's first impeachment. The treatment of Yovanovitch—subjecting a 33-year diplomatic veteran to public smears, character assassination, and professional destruction—sent a message to the entire foreign service: loyalty to constitutional duties and professional ethics would be punished, while those willing to participate in corruption schemes would be rewarded.
