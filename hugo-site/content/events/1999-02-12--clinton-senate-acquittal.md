The U.S. Senate votes to acquit President Bill Clinton on both articles of impeachment following a five-week trial. On the perjury charge (Article I), the Senate votes 45-55, with 45 Democrats and 10 Republicans voting "not guilty." On the obstruction of justice charge (Article II), the Senate splits 50-50, with all 45 Democrats and 5 Republicans voting "not guilty." Neither charge achieves even a simple majority, far short of the two-thirds supermajority (67 votes) required for conviction and removal from office.

The Senate trial featured presentations by House Republican managers arguing for conviction, testimony from three witnesses via videotaped deposition (including Monica Lewinsky), and arguments by Clinton's defense team. The defense successfully argued that while Clinton's conduct was inappropriate and morally indefensible, it did not rise to the constitutional standard of "high crimes and misdemeanors" warranting removal from office. Some senators who voted for acquittal indicated they would have supported censure as an alternative form of accountability.

The acquittal allows Clinton to complete his second term, which ends in January 2001. The impeachment and trial remain controversial, with Republicans arguing that Clinton's perjury and obstruction undermined the rule of law and the integrity of the presidency, while Democrats and Clinton supporters contend the charges were driven by partisan motivations over personal misconduct unrelated to presidential duties. The proceedings establish precedents about the scope of impeachable offenses and the role of partisan politics in constitutional accountability mechanisms.
