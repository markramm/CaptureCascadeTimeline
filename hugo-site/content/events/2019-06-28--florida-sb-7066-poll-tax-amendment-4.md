Governor Ron DeSantis signs Senate Bill 7066 into law, requiring people with felony convictions to pay all fines, fees, court costs, and restitution before regaining voting rights—directly undermining the intent of Amendment 4, which Florida voters approved with 65% support just seven months earlier. Critics immediately denounce the law as a modern-day poll tax that creates a wealth-based barrier to voting rights restoration.

## Amendment 4 Undermining

Amendment 4, approved by nearly two-thirds of Florida voters in November 2018, restored voting rights to people with felony convictions who had "completed all terms of their sentence." The amendment's language was intentionally focused on completion of criminal sentences—prison time, probation, and parole.

However, SB 7066 redefines "all terms of sentence" to include payment of all financial obligations: fines, fees, court costs, and restitution. This interpretation dramatically limits Amendment 4's impact. Many people with felony convictions owe thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in court-imposed financial obligations and lack the means to pay them. The law effectively makes voting rights contingent on wealth rather than completion of criminal sentences.

The Florida Legislature's redefinition of Amendment 4's terms represents a direct effort to subvert the will of voters. The Republican-controlled legislature, which had opposed Amendment 4 and refused to address felony disenfranchisement for decades, now moves swiftly to limit the amendment's implementation through statutory restrictions.

## The Poll Tax Problem

Legal challenges immediately characterize SB 7066 as a poll tax—conditioning the right to vote on payment of money. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1964, explicitly prohibits poll taxes in federal elections. While SB 7066 doesn't require direct payment to vote, critics argue that requiring payment of fines and fees before voting rights restoration constitutes a financial condition on voting that violates both the Twenty-Fourth Amendment and Equal Protection principles.

The law creates a wealth-based voting system: affluent people with felony convictions can immediately pay their financial obligations and regain voting rights, while poor people with identical convictions and sentences remain disenfranchised indefinitely due to inability to pay. This creates precisely the kind of economic barrier to voting that poll taxes historically imposed.

Florida's court system compounds the problem through extensive fees and costs imposed on defendants, often totaling thousands of dollars for relatively minor offenses. Courts impose not just fines (punishment) but also "fees" (administrative costs), court costs, public defender fees, and other charges. Many people with felony convictions have no realistic ability to pay these accumulated costs, making their disenfranchisement effectively permanent despite completing their criminal sentences.

## Implementation Chaos

SB 7066's implementation reveals additional problems. The state lacks comprehensive records of who owes what amounts—different counties use different systems, records are incomplete or inaccurate, and there is no centralized database showing individuals' total financial obligations. This means many people cannot even determine whether they owe money or how much, making compliance impossible.

The law provides no mechanism for individuals to determine their eligibility or for the state to waive financial obligations for those unable to pay. People seeking to register to vote face uncertainty about whether they qualify, with potential criminal prosecution for registering if they unknowingly still owe money. This creates a chilling effect where eligible voters avoid registering for fear of prosecution.

In May 2020, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle rules that while Florida can require payment of financial obligations for those able to pay, the state cannot prohibit voting for those genuinely unable to pay their obligations. However, implementing this ruling proves challenging given the state's lack of clear records and processes for determining ability to pay.

## Impact on Amendment 4

SB 7066 dramatically reduces Amendment 4's impact. While 1.4 million Floridians were estimated to benefit from Amendment 4, analysis suggests that hundreds of thousands—potentially the majority—remain disenfranchised under SB 7066 due to outstanding financial obligations they cannot pay.

The law particularly impacts Black Floridians, who faced higher rates of felony disenfranchisement under the previous system and who disproportionately lack resources to pay accumulated court debt. Research shows that court debt falls disproportionately on poor communities and communities of color, making the financial payment requirement racially discriminatory in effect.

## Political Motivation and Timing

The swift passage of SB 7066—just seven months after Amendment 4's overwhelming victory—demonstrates partisan motivation. The Republican-controlled legislature and Republican Governor DeSantis move quickly to limit Amendment 4's implementation before the 2020 election cycle, when Florida will again be a crucial swing state in the presidential election.

The law targets a population that leans Democratic, given racial and socioeconomic demographics of people with felony convictions and court debt. By imposing financial barriers to rights restoration, Republicans effectively reduce the pool of new voters who might alter Florida's electoral balance.

The immediate lawsuits and implementation chaos suggest the legislature prioritized limiting Amendment 4 over creating workable policy. The lack of systems to track financial obligations or determine ability to pay indicates that preventing rights restoration, not orderly implementation, was the primary goal.

## Significance

SB 7066 represents a brazen attempt to subvert direct democracy and thwart the will of Florida voters. Nearly 65% of voters—including majorities in both red and blue counties—supported Amendment 4's voting rights restoration. The legislature's quick move to undermine the amendment through restrictive implementation demonstrates contempt for popular will when it conflicts with partisan interests.

The law exemplifies modern voter suppression tactics: using ostensibly neutral requirements (paying court debt) that have discriminatory effects based on wealth and race. Like historical poll taxes, SB 7066 creates a financial barrier to voting that disproportionately disenfranchises poor people and people of color while maintaining plausible deniability about discriminatory intent.

The poll tax characterization is apt and powerful. Florida replaces one form of mass disenfranchisement (lifetime bans) with another (wealth-based barriers), achieving similar exclusionary effects through different means. The law ensures that many people who completed their criminal sentences remain permanently excluded from democracy due to poverty.

SB 7066 also demonstrates how voting rights victories can be undermined through implementation. Even when voters directly approve rights expansion through constitutional amendments, legislatures hostile to that expansion can limit impact through restrictive statutory interpretation and implementation requirements.

The law's chaos and uncertainty—inability to determine who owes what, lack of processes for ability-to-pay determinations, threat of criminal prosecution for mistaken registration—creates a system designed to discourage rights restoration rather than facilitate it. This represents administrative suppression: using bureaucratic complexity and uncertainty to deter eligible voters from participating.

The contrast between Amendment 4's overwhelming popular support and SB 7066's swift legislative restriction exposes the fundamental tension in American democracy between popular sovereignty and legislative self-interest. When given direct say, Florida voters support inclusive democracy; when filtered through a legislature that benefits from restricted electorates, the result is continued disenfranchisement.
