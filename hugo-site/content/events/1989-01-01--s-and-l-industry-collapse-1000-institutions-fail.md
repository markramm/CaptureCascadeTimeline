By 1989, over 1,000 savings and loan institutions have failed, representing approximately one-third of the entire S&L industry and marking one of the worst financial industry collapses in American history. The systemic failure stems directly from 1980s deregulation that eliminated prudential lending standards while maintaining federal deposit insurance, creating massive moral hazard that incentivized fraud and reckless speculation. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) becomes insolvent trying to cover losses, ultimately requiring a $160 billion taxpayer bailout when the Resolution Trust Corporation is created to liquidate failed institutions.

The S&L collapse follows a predictable pattern after the 1982 Garn-St. Germain Act eliminated loan-to-value ratios and interest rate caps while allowing S&Ls to invest in commercial real estate and junk bonds. Institutions that had operated conservatively for decades suddenly engaged in wild speculation, self-dealing, and fraud, knowing federal deposit insurance meant taxpayers would absorb losses. Regulatory agencies, starved of resources and captured by industry, failed to supervise the orgy of risk-taking. By the time regulators acted, losses had grown from manageable to catastrophic, with fraud involved in roughly 70-80% of failed institutions.

The industry collapse demonstrates the inevitable outcome of "free market" fundamentalism: deregulation without corresponding risk management destroyed an entire industry sector and required massive government intervention to prevent total financial system collapse. Conservative ideology held that markets would self-regulate through competition, but instead, removal of prudential regulation led to a race to the bottom as honest institutions couldn't compete with fraudulent ones offering unsustainable returns. The lesson—that deregulation plus government guarantees equals catastrophe—would be forgotten two decades later when similar deregulation of commercial banking produced the 2008 financial crisis at far larger scale.
