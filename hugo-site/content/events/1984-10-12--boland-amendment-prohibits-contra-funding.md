Congress passes the most restrictive version of the Boland Amendment, explicitly prohibiting any U.S. government agency involved in intelligence activities from providing support for military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. The amendment, effective from October 3, 1984, to December 3, 1985, states unambiguously that "no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities" may be used for "supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua."

Named for Massachusetts Representative Edward Boland who authored it, the amendment represents Congress's attempt to reassert constitutional authority over foreign policy after revelations of CIA involvement in mining Nicaraguan harbors and other covert operations. The legislation aims to end the Reagan administration's proxy war against Nicaragua's Sandinista government by cutting off all funding channels, closing loopholes that allowed the administration to claim different funding sources for Contra support.

Despite the explicit prohibition, the Reagan administration systematically circumvents the Boland Amendment through the Iran-Contra scheme. Between 1984 and 1986, President Reagan and NSC staff raise $34 million for the Contras from third countries including Saudi Arabia, and later divert proceeds from illegal arms sales to Iran. NSC staff member Oliver North coordinates this shadow operation, directly violating the law's clear language that prohibited support from "any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities."

The Iran-Contra affair thus represents not merely a policy disagreement but a fundamental constitutional crisis where executive branch officials deliberately violated explicit congressional prohibitions. The scandal demonstrates how national security secrecy can be weaponized to circumvent democratic oversight, with officials claiming that covert operations exist in a legal gray zone beyond congressional authority. The Boland Amendment's failure to prevent illegal Contra funding exposes the limits of legislative oversight when executive officials are willing to break the law.
