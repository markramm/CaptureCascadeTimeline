Purdue Pharma's lucrative bonus system paid sales representatives an average of $71,500 in annual bonuses—more than their $55,000 base salary—with bonuses ranging from $15,000 to nearly $240,000. In 2001 alone, Purdue paid $40 million in sales incentive bonuses, systematically incentivizing representatives to increase OxyContin sales in their territories by targeting physicians with the highest rates of opioid prescriptions.

## Targeting High-Volume Prescribers

The company structured bonuses to focus on healthcare providers who prescribed the most drugs, termed "core" and "super core" prescribers. This use of prescriber profiling data to target high-opioid prescribers—coupled with very lucrative incentives—fueled increased prescribing by the most liberal prescribers of opioids and, in many cases, the least discriminate.

A lucrative bonus system encouraged sales representatives to increase sales of OxyContin in their territories, resulting in a large number of visits to physicians with high rates of opioid prescriptions. The bonus structure created powerful financial incentives for representatives to ignore warning signs of overprescribing and abuse.

## Deterrent to Reporting Abuse

Purdue's Incentive Bonus Program actively deterred sales representatives from reporting overprescribing healthcare providers. Since bonuses were tied directly to prescription volume, representatives had strong financial disincentives to flag doctors who were prescribing dangerously high quantities of OxyContin—even when those prescriptions contributed to addiction and death.

## Scale of Marketing Investment

The $40 million in bonuses represented a significant portion of Purdue's approximately $200 million marketing expenditure in 2001. This investment strategy prioritized sales growth over patient safety, creating a system where corporate profits directly depended on maximizing opioid distribution regardless of medical necessity or patient harm.

## Pattern of Corporate Impunity

When Purdue pleaded guilty to criminal misbranding in 2007, the company paid $634 million in fines but no executives received jail time. The bonus system that incentivized overprescribing remained largely intact throughout the period when OxyContin contributed to hundreds of thousands of American deaths, demonstrating systematic failure to hold pharmaceutical executives personally accountable for deadly business practices.

This perverse incentive structure transformed Purdue's sales force into systematic drivers of the opioid epidemic, prioritizing corporate profits over public health with devastating consequences for American communities.
