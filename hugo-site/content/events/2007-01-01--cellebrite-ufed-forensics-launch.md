Cellebrite establishes its Mobile Forensics Division and introduces the first version of the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), a portable tool capable of extracting both physical and logical data from mobile phones, including deleted data and encrypted or password-protected information. This groundbreaking technology fundamentally transforms mobile forensics, providing law enforcement agencies worldwide with unprecedented ability to access digital evidence from seized devices. The UFED can bypass phone security features, extract complete device contents, and recover data that users believe they have permanently deleted. The device quickly becomes the industry standard for law enforcement's digital evidence collection, deployed by thousands of police departments, federal agencies, and military units globally. The launch represents a pivotal shift in digital surveillance capabilities, creating tools that can comprehensively breach mobile device privacy protections without requiring cooperation from manufacturers or users.
