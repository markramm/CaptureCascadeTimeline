Amazon Web Services wins a $600 million contract to build a private cloud computing infrastructure for the Central Intelligence Agency, marking the CIA's first major cloud computing contract and establishing Amazon as a central infrastructure provider for the U.S. intelligence community. The contract, known as C2S (Commercial Cloud Services), faced legal challenges from IBM, which protested the award. IBM argued that its proposal would save the CIA $54 million and filed a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office in June 2013.

The GAO initially sustained IBM's protest, temporarily halting the contract. However, on October 7, 2013, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of AWS, allowing Amazon to immediately resume work. The CIA defended its selection, stating it chose AWS for its "superior technical solution" rather than cost considerations.

This contract represents a watershed moment in the integration of private corporate infrastructure into core intelligence operations. By outsourcing critical intelligence infrastructure to a commercial cloud provider, the CIA creates unprecedented corporate access to classified data and intelligence operations. The contract establishes Amazon as an essential vendor for intelligence community operations, creating both financial incentives for Amazon to maintain close government relationships and potential conflicts of interest regarding data privacy, surveillance capabilities, and corporate influence over intelligence priorities.

The C2S contract becomes the foundation for AWS's expansion across the intelligence community, ultimately serving all 17 intelligence agencies and establishing a pattern of government dependence on Amazon's commercial cloud infrastructure for classified operations. This consolidation of intelligence infrastructure under a single commercial provider raises significant concerns about monopolization of critical government capabilities, data security, and the blurring of lines between corporate and state surveillance apparatus.
