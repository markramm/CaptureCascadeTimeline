Declassified documents revealed that Yahoo secretly fought the NSA's PRISM surveillance program in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court from 2007-2008, challenging the constitutionality of government demands for direct server access to user data. Yahoo argued the demands violated the Fourth Amendment and would compromise the privacy of all its users, not just surveillance targets.

The FISA Court ruled against Yahoo in April 2008, and as Yahoo prepared to appeal to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, the government threatened to impose fines of $250,000 per day, with the amount doubling each week if Yahoo refused to comply. At this escalation rate, the fines could have reached trillions of dollars within weeks, making continued resistance financially impossible.

Rather than face bankruptcy, Yahoo began providing the requested user data while continuing its legal appeal. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review ultimately upheld the lower court's decision, establishing legal precedent that government officials used to convince other Silicon Valley companies that PRISM demands had been tested in court and found constitutional. The documents detailing this secret legal battle were only declassified in September 2014 after sustained pressure following Edward Snowden's revelations, revealing how the government used extreme financial coercion to force tech company compliance with mass surveillance programs.

This case established the template for NSA's approach to tech companies: challenge us in court, lose in secret, face escalating financial penalties, then comply while maintaining public silence under gag orders.
