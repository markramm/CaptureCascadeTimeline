Cellebrite is established in Petah Tikva, Israel by founders Avi Yablonka, Yaron Baratz, and Yuval Aflalo. Initially focused on phone-to-phone data transfer technology for wireless carriers and retail operations, the company develops tools to help consumers transfer contacts, photos, and other data when upgrading mobile devices. This early expertise in accessing and extracting mobile phone data will later form the foundation for Cellebrite's evolution into one of the world's leading mobile device forensics companies, serving law enforcement and intelligence agencies globally. The company's core competency in bypassing phone security systems and extracting stored data, initially developed for consumer convenience, will eventually be repurposed for digital surveillance and criminal investigations.
