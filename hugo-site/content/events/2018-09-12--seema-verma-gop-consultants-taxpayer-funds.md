Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma spent more than $5 million in taxpayer funds on Republican-connected communications consultants to boost her personal profile, according to a July 2020 HHS Inspector General report. The 15-month investigation concluded that Verma violated federal contracting rules by directing high-paid contracts to politically connected consultants from June 2017 to April 2019. In September 2018, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. called for an investigation after reports emerged of Verma quietly directing millions of dollars to GOP communications consultants for personal image enhancement rather than legitimate government communications needs.

## Background

The HHS IG investigation began in April 2019 after Politico's reporting raised questions about the legality of the consultant contracts. Verma brought in contractors to provide strategic communications advice focused on raising her personal profile rather than advancing CMS's mission. The contracts were only halted after the Politico investigation brought public scrutiny, by which point the agency had paid out over $5 million to the contractors. The consultants had Republican political connections but lacked healthcare policy expertise, suggesting their primary value was political rather than substantive.

Bicameral health leaders urged the HHS Office of Inspector General to investigate Verma's use of millions in taxpayer funds on GOP consultants, noting the expenditures appeared designed to enhance her personal brand rather than serve CMS's mission to administer Medicare and Medicaid programs serving over 100 million Americans. Democrats' investigation found the consultant spending was part of a broader pattern of misused taxpayer funds and ethics violations during Verma's tenure. The IG report's finding that Verma violated federal contracting rules confirmed the spending was not merely wasteful but illegal.

## Significance

Verma's $5 million in taxpayer-funded personal brand consulting represented one of the Trump administration's most brazen examples of using public funds for personal benefit. The violation of federal contracting rules - not just ethical guidelines - established clear legal wrongdoing beyond policy disagreements about appropriate spending. The focus on elevating Verma's personal profile rather than CMS's mission revealed the narcissism and self-dealing that characterized Trump political appointees. The use of Republican political consultants rather than healthcare communications experts demonstrated the fundamental confusion between campaign politics and government service. The contracts' continuation until exposed by investigative journalism, rather than internal oversight, showed the failure of ethics compliance mechanisms. Verma's spending on personal image while overseeing programs serving America's elderly, disabled, and poor populations exemplified the administration's priority of political appointees' personal interests over public service.
