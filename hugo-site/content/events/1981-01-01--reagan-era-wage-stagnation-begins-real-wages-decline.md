Real wages for American workers begin a prolonged period of stagnation and decline during the Reagan era, with median hourly wages falling nearly a dollar from $16.90 to $16.00 between 1980-1990. Average real hourly wages for production and nonsupervisory workers—representing the vast majority of American employees—remain below pre-Reagan levels throughout his presidency, continuing the decline that began in 1973 but accelerating under Reagan policies. Median hourly wages for all workers end the decade 0.6% lower than they started, even as GDP grows and corporate profits soar, demonstrating that economic growth no longer translates into wage gains for working Americans.

The wage stagnation stems directly from Reagan administration policies that systematically undermine worker bargaining power: destroying the PATCO union in 1981 signals open season on organized labor, while tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy fail to "trickle down" to workers as promised by supply-side theory. Union membership declines precipitously during the 1980s as employers adopt aggressive union-busting tactics with government encouragement. Financial deregulation enables corporate focus on short-term stock prices and executive compensation rather than worker wages, while weakened labor standards enforcement allows wage theft and worker misclassification to proliferate.

The Reagan-era wage stagnation represents a fundamental break in the post-World War II social contract where productivity gains were shared between capital and labor. From 1948-1973, productivity and worker compensation grew in tandem; after Reagan, productivity continues growing while wages stagnate, with all gains flowing to capital owners and executives. This divergence creates the foundation for massive wealth inequality that defines the next four decades: workers produce more but earn less, while the wealthy capture productivity gains. The pattern establishes American economic dysfunction for generations: GDP growth no longer improves living standards for working families, requiring two-income households and rising consumer debt to maintain middle-class status.
