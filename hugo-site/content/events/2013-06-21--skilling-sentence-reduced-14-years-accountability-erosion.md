On June 21, 2013, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake approved a deal reducing former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling's prison sentence from 24 years to 14 years—a 10-year reduction that symbolized the erosion of corporate accountability in the decade following the Enron prosecutions. The sentence reduction came five years after the 2008 financial crisis, during which no major Wall Street executives faced criminal prosecution despite fraud far exceeding Enron's scale.

The reduction was negotiated between Skilling's lawyers and the Justice Department, partially based on a 2009 appeals court ruling that found errors in the original sentencing guidelines calculation. In exchange for the reduced sentence, Skilling gave up approximately $42 million to be distributed to Enron fraud victims and agreed not to pursue further legal appeals. With standard reductions for good behavior, Skilling was expected to be released as early as 2017.

The timing and symbolism of the sentence reduction was significant. In 2006, when Skilling received his original 24-year sentence, federal prosecutors were still aggressively pursuing criminal accountability for corporate fraud. By 2013, that era had definitively ended. Despite the 2008 financial crisis causing far greater economic damage than Enron—destroying trillions in wealth and millions of jobs—the Justice Department had chosen deferred prosecution agreements and corporate fines over criminal prosecution of executives.

Skilling was ultimately released from federal custody in August 2018 after serving just 12 years. The arc from his initial 24-year sentence to his actual 12-year imprisonment perfectly illustrated the collapse of executive accountability: from Arthur Andersen's destruction (85,000 jobs lost) and Bernard Ebbers' 25-year sentence in 2005, to zero Wall Street executives imprisoned after 2008. The Skilling sentence reduction marked a symbolic endpoint—the brief post-Enron accountability moment was over, and corporate fraud had again become a civil rather than criminal matter.
