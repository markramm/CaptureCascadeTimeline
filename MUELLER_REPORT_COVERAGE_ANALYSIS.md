## Conclusion

The timeline's Mueller coverage is **good but incomplete**. It excels at documenting the **political corruption narrative** but misses the **formal legal accountability milestones** that define the investigation's historical significance.

**Adding 10-15 events focused on indictments, guilty pleas, report release, and Mueller testimony would transform coverage from "solid" to "comprehensive."**

These events are critical because they represent:
1. **First charges ever against Russian government for election interference**
2. **Historic prosecutions of presidential campaign officials**
3. **Constitutional crisis over obstruction of justice**
4. **Battle over transparency and accountability**

Without these events, the timeline tells the corruption story but misses the legal reckoning (and its ultimate failure through pardons).
