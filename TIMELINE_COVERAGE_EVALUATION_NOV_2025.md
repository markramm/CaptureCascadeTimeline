## 2025 Data Anomaly Analysis

**Issue**: 1,027 events dated 2025 (vs. 66-133 for other recent years)

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Projection/Planning Events**: Events created as anticipated corruption patterns
2. **Dating Error**: Events that should be backdated to actual occurrence
3. **Trump Second Term Documentation**: Aggressive documentation of current administration
4. **Duplicate Detection Needed**: Possible duplicate events with different IDs

**Recommendation**:
- Audit 2025 events for proper dating
- Verify events are actual occurrences vs. projections
- Check for duplicates
- Move projection/planning events to separate tracking system
