In his final hours as president, Donald Trump issued 73 pardons and 70 commutations—143 acts of clemency in a single day, overwhelming the typical pardon process and demonstrating systematic corruption of executive power. The pardons went almost exclusively to political allies, campaign donors, and loyalists while conspicuously excluding family members and Rudy Giuliani, suggesting Trump's legal advisers warned him against pardons that could be challenged as obstruction of justice.

## Steve Bannon - "We Build the Wall" Fraud

Trump pardoned former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who had been indicted for defrauding Trump's own supporters in the "We Build the Wall" fundraising scheme. Federal prosecutors charged that Bannon and three others siphoned $25 million from donors who believed their contributions would fund border wall construction. Bannon personally took over $1 million while publicly claiming "100% of the money" went to the wall.

The pardon was particularly brazen because Bannon had been arrested just months earlier in August 2020 aboard a Chinese billionaire's yacht. Prosecutors documented how Bannon used a shell company and fake invoices to hide his payments. The pardon came despite Bannon's falling out with Trump after publishing critical comments in Michael Wolff's book "Fire and Fury"—suggesting the pardon served strategic purposes beyond personal loyalty.

## Elliott Broidy - Foreign Lobbying and Bribery

Trump pardoned Elliott Broidy, a Republican megadonor who pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws by funneling millions from foreign nationals while lobbying the Trump administration. Broidy admitted to working as an unregistered foreign agent for Chinese and Malaysian interests, attempting to end a Department of Justice investigation into the 1MDB scandal and to arrange for the extradition of Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui.

Broidy had been deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee and raised over $100 million for Trump. He was also connected to the pardon bribery investigation revealed in December 2020 court filings. His pardon demonstrated the pay-to-play nature of Trump's clemency process—major donors received pardons for serious crimes including foreign influence operations targeting the U.S. government.

## Ken Kurson - Cyberstalking

Trump pardoned Ken Kurson, a friend of Jared Kushner who was charged with cyberstalking his ex-wife and two other individuals. Kurson allegedly hacked into his wife's computer, sent threatening messages, and surveilled her online activities. He had served as editor of the New York Observer when it was owned by Jared Kushner and maintained close ties to the Trump family.

## Systematic Pattern

The final-day pardons revealed a systematic pattern of corruption:

- **Campaign allies**: Manafort, Stone, and others who protected Trump from investigations
- **Major donors**: Broidy and other Republican megadonors who gave millions
- **Family connections**: Charles Kushner (Jared's father), Kurson (Kushner ally)
- **Fraud perpetrators**: Bannon (defrauding Trump supporters), multiple financial crimes

Notably absent were pardons Trump had reportedly considered for himself, his children, and Rudy Giuliani. Legal advisers apparently convinced Trump these pardons could constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt and obstruction of justice. The omissions suggested even Trump recognized legal limits on his ability to grant immunity to those most directly implicated in his own potential crimes.

## Bypassing DOJ Review

The 143 acts of clemency in a single day made thorough Department of Justice review impossible. The Office of the Pardon Attorney—which typically conducts extensive investigations of clemency applications—was completely bypassed. Most pardons went to individuals who had not even filed formal applications through the proper channels.

White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputies reportedly fought against many of the pardons, warning they could constitute crimes themselves if part of corrupt bargains. The sheer volume of last-minute pardons suggested Trump was fulfilling promises made to donors and allies throughout his presidency.

## Significance

Trump's final-day pardon spree represented the culmination of four years of systematic corruption of the pardon power. Rather than grants of mercy based on rehabilitation or injustice, these pardons rewarded loyalty, repaid political debts, and protected those who could implicate Trump in crimes. The pardons demonstrated Trump's view of presidential power as a personal asset to be monetized and wielded for corrupt purposes, not a constitutional duty to be exercised in the public interest.
