On November 18, 2025, six Democratic members of Congress—all military and intelligence veterans—released an extraordinary video directly addressing active-duty service members and intelligence community personnel, reminding them of their constitutional obligation to refuse illegal orders. The lawmakers included Senator Elissa Slotkin (D-MI, former CIA officer), Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ, Navy captain), Representative Jason Crow (D-CO, former Army Ranger and paratrooper), Representative Chris DeLuzio (D-PA, Navy veteran), Representative Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA, Air Force veteran), and Representative Maggie Goodlander (D-NH, former intelligence officer). In the video posted to social media, they stated: "We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now. This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders."

The video, which concluded with the 1812 naval phrase "Don't give up the ship" from Captain James Lawrence, emphasized that service members swore oaths to protect and defend the Constitution, not to execute potentially unconstitutional directives. The lawmakers did not specify particular policies they were challenging, instead maintaining a general constitutional framework focused on the fundamental duty to refuse unlawful commands. However, the video came amid expanding military involvement in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations, including deployment of 4,000 active-duty personnel to the southern border, use of military aircraft for deportations, assignment of 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges, and preparation of Guantanamo Bay facilities to house detained migrants. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had publicly stated that "lawful orders of the president of the United States will be executed swiftly and without excuse."

President Trump responded with unprecedented threats against the lawmakers, posting on Truth Social that their video represented "SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!" and demanding they be "ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL." Trump also shared posts stating "Hang them George Washington would." White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller condemned the video as "openly calling for insurrection," while Defense Secretary Hegseth dismissed it as "Stage 4 TDS" (Trump Derangement Syndrome). House Speaker Mike Johnson called the video "wildly inappropriate," "dangerous," and "unprecedented in American history," though he attempted to downplay Trump's death penalty threats by claiming the president was merely "defining the crime of sedition." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer forcefully condemned Trump's response, stating: "Let's be crystal clear: the President of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials. This is an outright threat, and it's deadly serious. He is lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline."

The video represents a remarkable and unusual intervention by members of Congress, who rarely if ever directly address military personnel about potential conflicts between presidential orders and constitutional duties. The fact that six lawmakers—all with distinguished military and intelligence service records—felt compelled to make such a statement signals extraordinary concern about the Trump administration potentially issuing orders that uniformed personnel might view as illegal, unconstitutional, or contrary to their oath of service. Trump's immediate response threatening the lawmakers with execution for sedition, rather than engaging with their constitutional arguments, further escalated the confrontation and raised alarms about whether the president views any questioning of his authority as punishable by death. The episode illuminates growing tensions between the executive branch's expanding use of military power for domestic purposes and Congress members' concerns about constitutional boundaries and military personnel being ordered to take actions against American citizens that may violate their oaths.
