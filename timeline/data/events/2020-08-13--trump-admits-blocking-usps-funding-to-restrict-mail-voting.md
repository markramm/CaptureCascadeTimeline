In a Fox Business interview with Maria Bartiromo, President Trump explicitly admitted that he was blocking emergency funding for the United States Postal Service in order to prevent the expansion of mail-in voting during the 2020 presidential election. "They need that money in order to have the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots," Trump stated, directly connecting his opposition to postal funding with restricting Americans' ability to vote by mail during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Trump's Explicit Confession

Trump's full statement left no ambiguity about his motivation: "Now, they need that money in order to make the Post Office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots. Now, if we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they can't have universal mail-in voting, they just can't have it." He specifically referenced "$25 billion for the Post Office" and "$3.5 billion for something that will turn out to be fraudulent—that's election money, basically," referring to funding to help states process mail ballots.

## Context of Systematic USPS Sabotage

Trump's admission came amid escalating controversy over Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's operational changes that were severely degrading mail service. DeJoy had ordered the removal of 671 high-speed mail sorting machines, eliminated overtime for postal workers, removed blue collection boxes from Democratic areas, and implemented other changes causing widespread mail delays. Trump's statement confirmed that these operational changes and his opposition to postal funding were coordinated elements of a deliberate strategy to suppress mail voting.

## Immediate Political and Legal Fallout

Democratic lawmakers immediately seized on Trump's confession as explicit evidence of election interference. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the remarks "a clear acknowledgment" that Trump was "sabotaging the election." Legal experts noted that Trump's statement could be used as evidence in multiple pending lawsuits challenging USPS operational changes. The admission undermined Republican defenses that DeJoy's changes were routine cost-cutting measures unrelated to the election, since the president himself had now explicitly linked postal funding to vote suppression.

## Significance

Trump's Fox Business interview represented an extraordinary moment where a sitting president openly admitted to using executive power to restrict Americans' voting rights. The statement constituted a confession of election interference, explicitly connecting opposition to postal funding with the goal of preventing mail-in voting. Combined with DeJoy's operational sabotage of USPS capabilities, Trump's admission revealed a coordinated executive branch strategy to suppress voting during a pandemic when mail ballots were essential for public health. The confession provided federal courts with direct presidential statements of intent when issuing orders blocking USPS changes, and established clear evidence that postal service degradation was politically motivated rather than operationally justified. It remains one of the most explicit admissions of election interference by any American president.
