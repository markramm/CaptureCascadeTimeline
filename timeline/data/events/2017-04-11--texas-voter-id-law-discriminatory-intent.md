A federal judge rules that Texas's voter ID law, widely considered the strictest in the nation, was intentionally designed to discriminate against Black and Latino voters. The ruling finds "a pattern of conduct unexplainable on grounds other than the race factor" and marks the second time federal courts conclude that Texas's law violates the Voting Rights Act and was enacted with discriminatory purpose. The law's acceptance of gun permits but rejection of student IDs exemplifies its partisan and racial targeting.

## The Law and Its Restrictions

Texas's voter ID law, enacted in 2011 and implemented after the *Shelby County* decision eliminated preclearance, requires voters to present one of seven specific forms of photo identification: Texas driver's license, Texas election identification certificate, Texas personal identification card, Texas concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID card, U.S. citizenship certificate with photo, or U.S. passport.

The law is characterized as the strictest in the nation due to its narrow list of acceptable IDs and lack of reasonable alternatives for voters who lack these specific documents. Approximately 600,000 registered Texas voters—disproportionately Black, Latino, elderly, poor, and disabled—lack the required forms of ID and face significant barriers to obtaining them.

## Discriminatory ID Acceptance Criteria

The law's choice of acceptable IDs reveals partisan and racial targeting. Texas accepts concealed handgun licenses but rejects student IDs from state universities. This distinction is particularly revealing given demographics: more than 80% of handgun licenses issued to Texans go to white residents, while more than half of students in the University of Texas system are racial or ethnic minorities.

The law also accepts military IDs and passports—forms of identification disproportionately held by affluent and white Texans—while rejecting forms more commonly held by young people and minorities. The selective acceptance criteria demonstrate that the law's purpose is not verifying identity but rather screening out particular demographic groups.

Federal courts note this pattern as evidence of discriminatory intent. If the goal were simply identity verification, student IDs from state universities (which include photos and are issued through official processes) would be more reliable than many accepted forms. The rejection of student IDs while accepting gun permits reveals partisan motivation—students lean Democratic while gun permit holders lean Republican.

## Court Findings of Discriminatory Intent

Federal District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos rules in April 2017 that the law was enacted with discriminatory intent, finding "a pattern of conduct unexplainable on grounds other than the race factor." This represents the second time a federal court finds discriminatory intent in Texas's voter ID law, following an earlier 2014 ruling.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled in July 2016 that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act due to its discriminatory effect on minority voters. The appellate court found that the law imposed greater burdens on minority voters and that Texas failed to justify these burdens with evidence of voter fraud or other legitimate concerns.

Texas courts rule in five separate cases that the voter ID law is intentionally discriminatory against minorities. The repeated findings of discriminatory intent—across multiple courts and judges—demonstrate a clear pattern that Texas designed the law to suppress minority voting.

## Disproportionate Impact on Minority Voters

Research and court findings document the law's severe impact on Black and Latino voters. Hispanic registered voters are 195% more likely than white voters to lack acceptable ID, while Black voters are 305% more likely to lack qualifying identification. These disparities result from socioeconomic factors (poverty rates, car ownership, access to DMV offices) and discriminatory effects of ID acquisition processes.

The law creates particular hardships for obtaining the "free" election identification certificate Texas offers as an alternative. Despite being nominally free, obtaining the certificate requires underlying documents (birth certificates, etc.) that cost money and time to obtain, creating what courts characterize as a "poll tax in practice." Many eligible voters, particularly elderly Texans and people born in rural areas, face difficulty obtaining the required underlying documentation.

Geographic barriers compound these problems. DMV offices where voters can obtain IDs are disproportionately located away from minority communities, with limited hours. Some counties have no DMV offices at all, requiring voters to travel significant distances. These barriers disproportionately affect low-income voters without cars or flexible work schedules.

## Timing and Political Context

Texas enacted the voter ID law in 2011 but implementation was blocked by Department of Justice preclearance under the Voting Rights Act. The DOJ found that the law would disproportionately impact Latino voters and violated Section 5. Within hours of the *Shelby County* decision eliminating preclearance in June 2013, Texas announced it would immediately implement the previously-blocked voter ID law.

This immediate implementation demonstrates that Texas had been waiting for preclearance requirements to end. The state's rush to implement a law federal authorities had determined was discriminatory exposes the continuing need for preclearance protections—vindicating Justice Ginsburg's *Shelby County* dissent.

The law's implementation before the 2014 and 2016 elections affects outcomes in this crucial swing state with large minority populations. Studies estimate that tens of thousands of eligible voters were unable to vote due to ID requirements, with disproportionate impact on likely Democratic voters.

## Partisan Motivation

The law's partisan origins are clear. Republican legislators enacted it over Democratic opposition, with debate revealing concerns about partisan advantage rather than election security. Republicans offered no credible evidence of in-person voter impersonation fraud—the only type of fraud the ID requirement could prevent—because such fraud is virtually nonexistent.

Studies consistently show that in-person voter fraud occurs at rates of 0.0003% to 0.0025%—statistically negligible. Texas presented no evidence of significant fraud justifying the law's burdens. Courts note this absence of justification as evidence of pretextual rather than legitimate motivation.

The selective ID acceptance criteria, timing, and lack of fraud evidence combine to demonstrate partisan intent. The law aims to reduce turnout among Democratic-leaning constituencies—young voters, minority voters, poor voters—while preserving access for Republican-leaning groups like gun permit holders.

## Significance

Texas's voter ID law demonstrates how modern voter suppression uses facially neutral requirements (show ID) to achieve discriminatory effects. The law doesn't explicitly mention race, but its design—which IDs are accepted, how IDs are obtained, where DMV offices are located—ensures disproportionate minority disenfranchisement.

The repeated federal court findings of discriminatory intent are significant. Courts are typically reluctant to find intentional discrimination, requiring substantial evidence. That multiple courts independently conclude Texas acted with discriminatory purpose demonstrates the law's egregious targeting of minority voters.

The gun permit vs. student ID distinction becomes iconic of voter suppression's partisan nature. This choice reveals that ID requirements aren't about election security—if they were, student IDs would be accepted—but about partisan advantage through selective demographic suppression.

The law's implementation immediately after *Shelby County* validates concerns about removing preclearance. Texas demonstrates that jurisdictions with discrimination histories will implement suppressive laws as soon as federal oversight ends, confirming the continuing need for Voting Rights Act protections.

Texas's voter ID law also illustrates the limits of litigation as remedy. Despite multiple court rulings finding the law discriminatory and unconstitutional, Texas continues defending and implementing variations of the law. Litigation takes years, during which discriminatory laws remain in effect affecting multiple elections. Courts eventually order relief, but damage done during years of litigation cannot be undone.

The case exemplifies the post-*Shelby County* landscape: states implement discriminatory laws, civil rights groups sue, courts eventually strike them down years later, states then implement modified versions and litigation begins again. This cycle allows suppression to operate for years before remedies, fundamentally disadvantaging minority voters and Democratic candidates.

Texas's voter ID law becomes a national model for strict photo ID requirements, with other Republican-controlled states copying its approach. The law's discriminatory effects and partisan advantages make it attractive to Republicans seeking to suppress Democratic-leaning constituencies under the guise of election integrity.
