On January 21, 2022, a Saudi-led coalition airstrike hit a detention facility in Sa'adah, northwestern Yemen, killing at least 80 people and wounding over 200 in what the United Nations described as the "worst civilian-casualty incident in the last three years in Yemen." Amnesty International weapons experts identified the munition as a US-made GBU-12 Paveway II 500-pound laser-guided bomb manufactured by Raytheon—the same weapon type documented in the 2016 funeral hall massacre, 2018 wedding bombing, and numerous other civilian-casualty incidents. The attack occurred just over one year after President Biden announced ending US support for Saudi "offensive operations" in Yemen and pausing Raytheon Paveway bomb sales, demonstrating that despite policy rhetoric, US-manufactured weapons continued killing Yemeni civilians under the Biden administration. Doctors Without Borders reported treating massive casualties in overwhelmed facilities, with survivors describing repeated strikes on rescuers attempting to evacuate the wounded—the characteristic "double-tap" pattern documented in previous Raytheon weapon attacks.

## Raytheon Paveway Bomb Despite Biden Pause

The January 21 attack's use of a Raytheon GBU-12 Paveway bomb occurred more than a year after Biden's February 2021 pause on new Paveway sales to Saudi Arabia. However, the pause applied only to pending sales, not to existing Saudi stockpiles of thousands of Raytheon Paveway munitions already delivered under previous contracts. The attack revealed the limited impact of Biden's policy shift: while new Paveway transfers faced restrictions, Saudi forces retained massive arsenals of previously-purchased US weapons that they continued using in attacks killing civilians. Amnesty International noted that the laser-guided bomb's presence provided evidence of continued US complicity in Yemen war crimes through weapons already delivered, even if future sales faced restrictions. The attack demonstrated that accountability for defense contractors required not just pausing new sales but also demanding cessation of hostilities using weapons already supplied—a level of pressure the Biden administration proved unwilling to apply despite campaign promises to fundamentally reassess the Saudi relationship.

## UN Characterization as Worst Attack in Three Years

The United Nations' characterization of the Sa'adah detention center strike as the worst civilian-casualty incident in three years highlighted both the attack's scale and the continuation of Saudi coalition war crimes. The 80 killed and 200+ wounded represented casualties comparable to the 2016 funeral hall massacre that had generated international outrage. UN officials noted the detention facility was known to the coalition and should not have been targeted under any circumstances, as detainees represented protected persons under international humanitarian law. The attack's timing—during a period of escalated coalition bombing following Houthi strikes on UAE facilities—suggested retaliation against civilian targets rather than military necessity. Human Rights Watch investigators found no evidence of legitimate military objectives at the detention center that could justify the attack under laws of war. The UN's strong characterization reflected frustration that years of documentation of civilian casualties had produced no meaningful coalition accountability or behavior changes despite US pressure.

## Double-Tap Pattern and Rescuer Casualties

Survivors and medical personnel reported that coalition aircraft conducted multiple strikes on the detention facility, with subsequent attacks hitting rescuers attempting to evacuate casualties—the "double-tap" methodology documented in numerous previous attacks including the 2016 Arhab water drilling site bombing. This tactic deliberately targeted first responders and medical personnel, violating fundamental principles of international humanitarian law requiring parties to protect wounded persons and medical operations. The repeated use of double-tap strikes across seven years of conflict demonstrated that such tactics represented coalition policy rather than isolated incidents. The methodology maximized casualties and terrorized civilian populations by making rescue operations deadly, discouraging humanitarian response even after initial strikes. For Raytheon, the precision-guided nature of Paveway bombs enabled this war crime tactic—the weapons' accuracy allowed deliberate targeting of specific locations including rescue sites, with coalition forces able to observe rescue operations and time subsequent strikes for maximum casualties among rescuers.

## Significance

The January 21, 2022 Raytheon Paveway bomb strike killing 80 at a Yemen detention center demonstrated that Biden administration policy changes had failed to end US complicity in Saudi coalition war crimes, as previously-delivered American weapons continued being used in massive civilian-casualty incidents despite presidential rhetoric about ending support for offensive operations. The attack occurred more than a year after Biden's February 2021 pause on new Paveway sales, revealing that selective weapons restrictions left intact the fundamental problem: Saudi forces possessed stockpiles of thousands of US precision-guided munitions and continued using them to kill civilians. Amnesty International's identification of a Raytheon GBU-12 provided direct evidence of American manufactured weapons in what the UN characterized as Yemen's worst civilian attack in three years, establishing continued US and Raytheon culpability regardless of paused future sales. The 80 deaths joined thousands of other Yemeni civilians killed by Saudi coalition forces using US weapons over seven years of conflict, demonstrating the failure of incremental policy adjustments to address systematic war crimes enabled by American arms transfers. For Raytheon, the Sa'adah attack represented another documented instance of its weapons being used in apparent war crimes, yet the company faced no accountability beyond temporary restrictions on specific new sales while maintaining billions in other Saudi contracts. The attack's double-tap pattern—deliberately targeting rescuers—illustrated how Raytheon's precision-guided weapons enabled rather than reduced war crimes by providing the accuracy to deliberately strike civilian targets and time subsequent attacks on rescuers. The detention facility bombing revealed the moral bankruptcy of Biden's distinction between "offensive" and "defensive" weapons: Raytheon Paveway bombs already delivered under previous "defensive" characterizations killed 80 civilians, demonstrating that all weapons transfers to war crimes-committing regimes enabled atrocities regardless of how the US government categorized them. The attack marked a continuing chapter in the longest documented case study of US defense contractor complicity in war crimes, with Raytheon weapons killing Yemeni civilians across three presidential administrations (Obama, Trump, Biden) despite recurring promises to hold Saudi Arabia accountable.
