At approximately 3:45 PM on August 15, 2016, a Saudi-led coalition airstrike struck the Abs Hospital in Yemen's Hajjah governorate, killing at least 11 people including an MSF staff member and injuring at least 19 others. The hospital was clearly marked as a medical facility and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders) had repeatedly provided the hospital's GPS coordinates to all parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition. Amnesty International weapons experts confirmed that the attack used a US-made precision-guided Paveway-series aerial bomb manufactured by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. The strike represented the fourth attack on an MSF medical facility in Yemen in less than 12 months, demonstrating a systematic pattern of attacks on protected healthcare infrastructure that violated fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.

## Raytheon Paveway Bomb Identified

Independent weapons experts retained by Amnesty International examined photographic and video evidence from the attack site and positively identified remnants of a US-made Paveway-series precision-guided bomb. The Paveway guidance system, jointly manufactured by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, converts standard unguided bombs into laser-guided precision munitions marketed as reducing civilian casualties through improved accuracy. However, the Abs Hospital attack demonstrated how precision-guided weapons enabled war crimes by allowing deliberate targeting of protected medical facilities. The hospital's location was well-documented, its GPS coordinates had been shared with coalition forces multiple times, and it was clearly identifiable as a medical facility with Red Crescent markings. The use of precision-guided munitions eliminated any defense that the attack resulted from targeting errors or poor accuracy. Coalition forces struck exactly where they intended—a functioning hospital treating wounded civilians.

## Protected Medical Facility Under International Law

International humanitarian law provides special protection to medical facilities, prohibiting attacks on hospitals, clinics, and medical personnel even during armed conflict. MSF had followed all recommended protocols for protecting its facilities, including sharing precise GPS coordinates with all warring parties through the UN's deconfliction mechanism designed specifically to prevent such attacks. The hospital was actively treating patients at the time of the strike, with medical staff clearly visible. MSF reported that this was the fourth attack against one of its facilities in Yemen in less than 12 months, indicating a pattern rather than isolated incidents. Following the Abs attack, MSF announced it would evacuate staff from six hospitals in Yemen's northern Saada and Hajjah governorates, stating it could no longer guarantee staff safety despite following all protection protocols. The withdrawal of MSF services left hundreds of thousands of Yemenis without access to critical medical care in an active war zone.

## US Arms Sales and Healthcare Destruction

The Abs Hospital bombing occurred while the United States provided extensive military support to the Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence sharing, aerial refueling, and billions of dollars in weapons sales from contractors including Raytheon. The attack demonstrated direct connections between US defense contractor profits and the destruction of Yemen's healthcare infrastructure. Raytheon specifically marketed its Paveway guidance systems as technology that reduced civilian casualties by improving targeting accuracy, yet the Abs Hospital strike revealed how this same technology enabled deliberate war crimes against protected facilities. Congressional critics noted that the attack occurred just weeks before major new Saudi arms deals were scheduled for approval, yet the Obama administration proceeded with weapons transfers despite mounting evidence of coalition war crimes. For Raytheon, the hospital bombing represented negative publicity but no interruption to Saudi contract revenue, illustrating how defense contractor profits remained insulated from accountability for weapons use.

## Significance

The Raytheon Paveway bomb strike on Abs Hospital exemplified the systematic destruction of Yemen's healthcare infrastructure using US-manufactured weapons, with Amnesty International characterizing the attack as evidence of potential war crimes. The 11 deaths included medical personnel protected under international law, and the strike's impact extended far beyond immediate casualties—MSF's subsequent withdrawal from six northern Yemen hospitals left hundreds of thousands of civilians without access to medical care in an active conflict zone. The attack demonstrated that the Saudi coalition's targeting problems resulted not from technological limitations but from deliberate policy choices, as precision-guided Raytheon munitions struck exactly where intended despite clear markings, shared coordinates, and international law protections. For US policymakers and defense contractors, the hospital bombing represented a test case: would documented use of American weapons in war crimes against protected medical facilities prompt arms sale suspensions, or would strategic and economic interests override humanitarian concerns? The answer came months later when the Obama administration's brief pause on precision-guided munitions transfers ended and arms sales resumed. The Abs Hospital attack established a pattern that would define the Yemen war—US defense contractors profiting from weapons used in systematic violations of international law, human rights organizations documenting the atrocities, and government officials prioritizing arms sale revenue over civilian protection.
