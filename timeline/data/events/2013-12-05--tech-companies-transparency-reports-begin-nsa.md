Following Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA surveillance, major tech companies began publishing transparency reports disclosing limited information about government data requests, marking the first time companies could publicly acknowledge FISA court orders. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and LinkedIn released reports in early 2014 covering the second half of 2013, revealing thousands of secret government demands for user data.

The companies had sued the Department of Justice in June 2013 for the right to disclose these numbers, arguing they had a First Amendment right to inform users about government surveillance. After negotiations, the government agreed to allow disclosure but imposed severe restrictions: companies could only report FISA requests in ranges of 1,000 (such as "0-999" or "1000-1999"), and data could only be published with a six-month delay.

The first transparency reports revealed the scope of secret surveillance: Microsoft received 15,000-15,999 user accounts affected by FISA content requests; Google reported 9,000-9,999 accounts; Yahoo disclosed 30,000-30,999 accounts; and Facebook reported 5,000-5,999 accounts. These numbers represented only a fraction of total government requests and provided no detail about what data was collected or why.

The transparency reports marked a significant shift in the relationship between tech companies and the surveillance state. While still operating under strict gag orders and unable to disclose meaningful details, companies began pushing back against the culture of total secrecy that had allowed programs like PRISM to operate in darkness. The reports also revealed that despite public denials, all major tech platforms were regularly compelled to provide user data to intelligence agencies, fundamentally changing public understanding of digital privacy and government access to personal information.
