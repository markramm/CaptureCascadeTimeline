Northrop Grumman Corporation paid the United States $11.4 million to settle government claims that it violated a 2002 settlement agreement with the Defense Contract Management Agency by improperly charging federal contracts for deferred compensation awards to key executives, demonstrating how defense contractors exploit cost-plus contracting to force taxpayers to subsidize lavish executive pay packages. The settlement resolved Federal Acquisition Regulation penalty claims and False Claims Act allegations stemming from Northrop's failure to honor its commitment to limit the amount of deferred compensation included in proposals for subsequent contracts after the 2002 settlement.

The government alleged that Northrop charged over $1.9 million in unallowable costs to federal contracts in 2004 by passing executive deferred compensation expenses through indirect cost rates applied to hundreds of contracts, forcing taxpayers across numerous programs to subsidize executive bonuses they had specifically agreed not to pay. Under Federal Acquisition Regulation rules, the penalty for charging unallowable costs is double the amount of the improper charges, suggesting that the $11.4 million settlement included approximately $5.7 million in penalties plus additional False Claims Act damages beyond the base $1.9 million in fraudulent charges. The case was developed through collaboration between the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Defense Contract Audit Agency's Western Region Investigative Support Division.

The fraud scheme reveals how defense contractors manipulate indirect cost accounting to bury executive compensation in overhead rates distributed across multiple contracts, making detection extremely difficult even for trained auditors. Indirect cost rates include general administrative expenses, facilities costs, and various overhead charges that are allocated across all contracts based on formulas rather than direct assignment to specific programs. By including executive deferred compensation in indirect cost pools, Northrop Grumman spread the unallowable charges across hundreds of contracts in amounts small enough to avoid immediate detection, requiring sophisticated forensic accounting to uncover the systematic violation.

The case demonstrates Northrop Grumman's brazen disregard for contractual commitments and regulatory compliance, as the company explicitly promised in the 2002 settlement to limit deferred compensation charges but then violated that agreement within two years. The willingness to break a settlement agreement with DCMA shows how defense contractors view compliance requirements as obstacles to maximize rather than constraints to respect, calculating that the profit from fraudulent billing exceeds the risk-adjusted cost of occasional settlements when caught. The repeat violation also reveals weak enforcement mechanisms, as the 2002 settlement clearly failed to include monitoring provisions or meaningful penalties sufficient to ensure Northrop's compliance.

As with Northrop Grumman's other fraud settlements, the company paid $11.4 million without admitting wrongdoing and no executives faced criminal prosecution despite personally benefiting from the fraudulent scheme through the deferred compensation awards that were illegally billed to taxpayers. The executives who received the lavish deferred compensation packages kept their ill-gotten bonuses while the company paid the settlement from corporate funds, ensuring that the individuals who actually committed and benefited from the fraud faced zero personal accountability. The settlement amount of $11.4 million represents a negligible fraction of Northrop's annual revenue and executive compensation budgets, making fraud a rational business decision even when caught and prosecuted.
