On November 20, 2025, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social calling for the arrest, trial, and execution of six Democratic members of Congress who had released a video two days earlier reminding military personnel of their constitutional duty to refuse illegal orders. Trump wrote: "This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???" Approximately 40 minutes later, he escalated with: "SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!" He also posted: "It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL." Trump additionally reposted a Truth Social user who wrote: "HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!" The targeted lawmakers are all military veterans or former intelligence officials: Senators Elissa Slotkin (Michigan) and Mark Kelly (Arizona), and Representatives Jason Crow (Colorado), Chris DeLuzio (Pennsylvania), Maggie Goodlander (New Hampshire), and Chrissy Houlahan (Pennsylvania).

The Democratic lawmakers' video, posted on Tuesday, November 18, featured the six members directly addressing active-duty military and intelligence personnel. They stated: "You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders" and "No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution." The video emphasized that service members take an oath to the Constitution, not to any individual, and warned about domestic threats to constitutional governance. The lawmakers made no calls for resistance to specific policies and did not mention Trump by name, instead focusing on the legal principle that military personnel have both the right and the obligation to refuse orders that violate the law or Constitution. Each of the six members has served in either the U.S. military or intelligence services, giving them direct credibility on military law and the chain of command.

The president's threats against sitting members of Congress for exercising their First Amendment rights and reminding service members of established military law represents an unprecedented escalation in authoritarian rhetoric from the Oval Office. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke from the Senate floor, stating: "The president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials. This is an outright threat, and it's deadly serious." Schumer warned: "When Donald Trump uses the language of execution and treason, some of his supporters may very well listen. He is lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline." Schumer later told reporters that he asked the U.S. Capitol Police to provide "special protection and keep an eye on Slotkin and Kelly" due to the severity of the threats. House Democratic leadership—Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark, and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar—issued a joint statement condemning "Donald Trump's disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress" and confirming they had contacted the Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police "to ensure the safety of these Members and their families."

The targeted lawmakers responded with a joint statement: "What's most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law." Senator Slotkin posted a video response saying: "I would hope that people of all backgrounds, Democrat, Republican, independent, would agree that threatening death for people you disagree with is beyond the pale of who we are as Americans." The lawmakers emphasized that they made no calls for opposition to Trump's policies but simply reminded service members of their existing legal obligations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and their oath to the Constitution. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, despite being a Trump ally, acknowledged the gravity of the situation, and several Republican lawmakers privately expressed concern about the president threatening elected officials with execution, though House Speaker Mike Johnson declined to condemn Trump's posts and instead blamed the Democratic lawmakers for the controversy.

When asked directly if Trump wants to execute members of Congress, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said "no," but then characterized the lawmakers' video as "conspiring together to orchestrate a video message...encouraging them to defy the President's lawful orders" and suggested it was "perhaps punishable by law." This response contradicted the video's actual content, which focused on illegal orders rather than lawful ones, and introduced the administration's position that reminding military personnel of their duty to refuse illegal orders might itself be criminal. Legal experts and constitutional scholars noted that Trump's threats constitute a profound violation of the separation of powers, an attempt to intimidate the legislative branch, and potential witness intimidation or obstruction given that several of the targeted lawmakers serve on committees investigating administration actions. The incident also raised concerns about stochastic terrorism—the use of mass communication to incite random actors to carry out violent acts that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable—particularly given the history of Trump supporters acting on his inflammatory rhetoric, including the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.

The constitutional crisis represented by a sitting president threatening elected officials with execution for exercising protected speech cannot be overstated. The First Amendment explicitly protects political speech, and members of Congress have additional Speech or Debate Clause protections under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution for statements made in connection with their legislative duties. The lawmakers' video reminded service members of established military law codified in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and Department of Defense regulations, which explicitly require military personnel to refuse unlawful orders. Trump's characterization of this legal reminder as "sedition" inverts the concept: sedition involves inciting rebellion against lawful authority, whereas the lawmakers were reinforcing the legal obligation to refuse unlawful authority. Trump's threats came amid ongoing concerns about his plans to use the military for domestic law enforcement, mass deportations, and potential actions against political opponents—precisely the scenarios where illegal orders might be issued and where service members would have a legal duty to refuse. The incident underscores the fragility of democratic norms when a president openly threatens violence against the legislative branch for reminding the military of its constitutional obligations.
