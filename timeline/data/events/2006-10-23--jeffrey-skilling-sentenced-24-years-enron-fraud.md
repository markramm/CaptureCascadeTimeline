On October 23, 2006, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was sentenced to 24 years and four months in federal prison for his role in the Enron fraud, representing one of the harshest sentences ever imposed on a corporate executive. U.S. District Judge Sim Lake also ordered Skilling to forfeit approximately $45 million to be applied toward restitution for victims of Enron's collapse.

Skilling, convicted on May 25, 2006, of 19 counts including securities fraud, wire fraud, insider trading, and conspiracy, served as Enron's CEO from February to August 2001—the critical period when the company's fraudulent accounting schemes unraveled. Prosecutors proved that Skilling knowingly participated in deceiving investors and employees about Enron's true financial condition while using complex off-balance-sheet partnerships to hide billions in debt and inflate profits.

The 24-year sentence came just three months after Enron founder Kenneth Lay died of a heart attack before his own sentencing hearing. Judge Lake's harsh sentence sent a message that top executives could not escape personal criminal accountability for corporate fraud, even when they claimed ignorance of the details of accounting manipulations they had authorized and profited from.

However, Skilling's sentence would mark the end, not the beginning, of aggressive executive prosecution. In 2013, Skilling's sentence was reduced to 14 years as part of a deal with prosecutors, and he was released from prison in August 2018 after serving just 12 years. More significantly, after the 2008 financial crisis—which involved fraud far exceeding Enron's scale—no major Wall Street CEOs went to prison at all. The Skilling prosecution represented the last time federal prosecutors successfully pursued lengthy prison sentences for Fortune 500 executives involved in systematic corporate fraud.
