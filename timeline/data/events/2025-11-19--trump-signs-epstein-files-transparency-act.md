On November 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law, announcing on Truth Social: "I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!" The announcement came one day after the House passed the bill 427-1 and the Senate approved it unanimously, forcing Trump to reverse his months-long opposition to releasing files about Jeffrey Epstein's criminal network. The law requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all unclassified Department of Justice records related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days in "a searchable and downloadable format," with files now due by December 19, 2025.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act contains exceptionally strong transparency language, explicitly prohibiting the DOJ from withholding or redacting records "on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary." The legislation requires the release of approximately 100,000 pages of FBI and DOJ investigative materials, including immunity deals, non-prosecution agreements, internal communications about prosecution decisions, and an unredacted list of "all government officials and politically exposed persons" connected to Epstein's criminal activities. However, the law permits four narrow exceptions: victims' personally identifiable information, child sexual abuse materials, classified national defense or foreign policy information, and materials that "would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution."

The "active investigation" exception has become the focal point of intense concern from both Republicans and Democrats who fear it will be exploited to prevent meaningful disclosure. Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY), a co-sponsor of the bill, warned that Trump's newly announced DOJ investigation into Democrats might be "a big smokescreen ... as a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files." The timing of events supports this concern: on November 14, 2025, Trump ordered Bondi to investigate former President Bill Clinton, ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman over their Epstein connections. Bondi quickly announced the investigation over the weekend, just two days before the House vote. She claimed "new information" warranted the probe but refused to specify what new evidence existed, despite the FBI stating in July 2025 that it had conducted an "exhaustive" review and "did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties."

The strategic timing and scope of Bondi's investigation raises serious questions about whether the administration will use the "active investigation" loophole to heavily redact the Epstein files despite the law's anti-redaction protections. Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) stated he was "not at all confident" the legislation would be implemented as written, predicting "more stonewalling, more cover-up." Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene questioned whether compliance represents the administration's "real test," asking: "Will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?" Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) warned Bondi that delaying the release would "add fuel to the fire" and that "if you do a blanket hold, I think that they're going to have a lot of people angry." The 30-day clock has now started, with December 19, 2025 as the statutory deadline for release, though concerns remain that the administration's newly created investigation will be invoked to justify extensive redactions of politically sensitive information about Trump and his allies while selectively exposing his political opponents.
