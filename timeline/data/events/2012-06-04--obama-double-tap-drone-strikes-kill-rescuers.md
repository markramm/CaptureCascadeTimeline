The Bureau of Investigative Journalism publishes comprehensive evidence that the CIA conducts "double-tap" drone strikes—following an initial strike with a second strike targeting rescuers, medical personnel, and civilians who rush to help victims. The investigation documents at least three cases where subsequent strikes killed first responders attempting to recover bodies and aid wounded victims, terrorizing communities and preventing people from providing humanitarian assistance. The double-tap tactic violates international humanitarian law prohibitions against targeting medical personnel and constitutes a war crime, yet the practice continues as deliberate CIA policy designed to maximize casualties and intimidate populations.

The investigation identifies specific double-tap incidents. On October 4, 2010, a drone strike in Datta Khel kills three alleged militants; 18 minutes later a second strike kills four more people including rescuers. On February 22, 2011, a strike in Ghazni Khel kills four people; within hours a second strike targeting the funeral gathering kills 30-41 people. On June 23, 2011, strikes in South Waziristan kill 16 people across multiple waves targeting those who responded to initial strikes. The pattern emerges clearly: first responders arriving to help wounded victims are deliberately targeted in follow-up strikes, with the CIA monitoring targets and timing subsequent strikes to maximize casualties among rescuers.

International humanitarian law provides special protection for medical personnel, ambulance workers, and those providing humanitarian assistance to wounded individuals. Deliberately targeting such personnel is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a war crime. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court explicitly criminalizes "intentionally directing attacks against...personnel...involved in a humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping mission." Yet the CIA's double-tap strikes do exactly this—using the humanitarian impulse to help wounded victims as a trap to kill rescuers.

The Stanford Law School and NYU School of Law conduct a comprehensive investigation documenting the psychological impact of double-tap strikes on Pakistani communities. Residents report being afraid to help victims of drone strikes for fear of being killed themselves in follow-up attacks. The constant threat of strikes—and particularly secondary strikes targeting rescuers—creates pervasive terror, with communities unable to conduct normal life functions. People avoid gathering for weddings, funerals, and tribal meetings. Farmers fear working fields. Children develop severe anxiety disorders from constant drone surveillance and unpredictable strikes. The double-tap tactic is specifically designed to terrorize, not just to kill individual targets.

The CIA also targets funeral gatherings and mourners. When a drone strike kills someone, family and community members gather for traditional funeral and burial rituals required by Islamic law. The CIA treats these gatherings as targets, either through intelligence claiming mourners are militants, or through signature strikes that classify gatherings of military-age males as legitimate targets regardless of whether they are funerals. The Bureau investigation documents at least four strikes on funeral gatherings, killing dozens of mourners including many civilians who had no connection to militancy beyond knowing someone killed in a previous strike.

The U.S. government refuses to acknowledge double-tap strikes as deliberate policy. When questioned, officials claim each strike is independently authorized based on specific intelligence about targets present at the location. However, the consistent pattern of secondary strikes arriving minutes to hours after initial strikes, timed to hit rescuers and mourners, reveals deliberate tactic rather than coincidental timing. Some former military and intelligence officials defend the practice by arguing that in militant areas, those who respond to strikes are likely militants themselves—a logic that defines all community members in certain regions as legitimate targets and abandons distinction between combatants and civilians.

The double-tap strikes exemplify how signature strikes and kill-list mentality corrupt the laws of war. Traditional rules of engagement require distinguishing combatants from civilians, proportionality in attacks, and special protection for medical personnel. Double-tap strikes abandon all these principles—they target people for providing humanitarian assistance, use timing to maximize casualties, and terrorize populations by making rescue missions lethal. The tactic represents industrial-scale cruelty: turning the human instinct to help wounded victims into a weapon, and treating entire communities as enemy populations where even medical response becomes grounds for execution. No investigations, prosecutions, or accountability result despite clear evidence of war crimes. The double-tap strikes demonstrate how drone warfare, combined with signature strike methodology and presumption that all killed are combatants, enables systematic violations of humanitarian law while preserving official deniability.
