Oracle Corporation launched an unsolicited hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft on June 6, 2003, with an initial cash tender offer of $16.00 per share, valuing the enterprise software competitor at approximately $5.1 billion. The timing proved particularly aggressive, as Oracle announced the bid only days after PeopleSoft had agreed to acquire JD Edwards for $1.7 billion, attempting to disrupt that transaction and absorb both companies.

PeopleSoft, a major provider of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and human capital management (HCM) software, immediately rejected Oracle's offer as inadequate and hostile. PeopleSoft's board implemented aggressive defensive measures, including an unprecedented Customer Assurance Program (CAP) that promised customers between two and five times their money back if Oracle acquired PeopleSoft and subsequently reduced support for PeopleSoft products. This defensive tactic aimed to make the acquisition economically unattractive by creating massive potential liabilities.

Oracle CEO Larry Ellison pursued the hostile takeover with characteristic aggression, repeatedly raising Oracle's offer price over the following 18 months while PeopleSoft's board consistently rejected each bid. The attempted acquisition exemplified Oracle's strategy of growth through aggressive consolidation of the enterprise software market, reducing competition and customer choice by absorbing competitors rather than competing on product merit.

The hostile takeover attempt triggered antitrust scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice, which recognized that Oracle's acquisition of PeopleSoft would substantially reduce competition in the enterprise software market. The DOJ's subsequent legal challenge highlighted concerns that the merger would eliminate a major competitor, potentially leading to higher prices, reduced innovation, and fewer choices for enterprise software customers. The initial hostile bid marked the beginning of an 18-month battle that would reshape the enterprise software industry and demonstrate the limitations of antitrust enforcement in preventing market consolidation.
