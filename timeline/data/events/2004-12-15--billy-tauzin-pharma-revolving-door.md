Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) announced that former House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) would become its president and CEO, effective January 2005. The announcement came shortly after Tauzin's retirement from Congress, where from 2001 to 2004 he had chaired the powerful committee that oversees the Food and Drug Administration. Tauzin would earn an estimated $2 million annually, making him one of the highest-paid lobbyists in Washington.

## The Medicare Part D Connection

Tauzin played the leading role in shepherding through Congress the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which brought a windfall estimated at $200 billion for the pharmaceutical industry. Most controversially, the legislation included a "noninterference clause" that explicitly prohibited Medicare from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies—a provision the industry had a major role in writing. This prohibition prevented the federal government from using its massive purchasing power to obtain discounts, forcing Medicare beneficiaries to pay significantly higher prices than other government programs like the Veterans Administration.

## Revolving Door Ethics Questions

Democrats criticized Tauzin throughout 2004 when rumors emerged that he was negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry for employment while simultaneously crafting Medicare legislation. Public Citizen accused Tauzin of potentially "negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation," raising serious questions about conflicts of interest. The speed of his transition—beginning work at PhRMA the day after his congressional term ended—reinforced concerns about quid pro quo arrangements between lawmakers and the industries they regulate.

## Pharmaceutical Industry Lobbying Power

Tauzin's appointment exemplified the pharmaceutical industry's extraordinary political influence. The industry had spent more on lobbying than any other sector since 1998, and by securing Tauzin's services, PhRMA gained direct access to his extensive congressional relationships and insider knowledge of healthcare policy. As one of the chief architects of Medicare Part D, Tauzin possessed invaluable intelligence about legislative strategy and regulatory vulnerabilities that would benefit his new employers for years to come.

## Significance

This revolving door case became emblematic of congressional corruption and regulatory capture in the 2000s. Tauzin's transition from writing pharmaceutical legislation to lobbying for pharmaceutical companies demonstrated how industry interests could effectively purchase congressional power through delayed compensation. The Medicare Part D noninterference clause—which prevented drug price negotiation until its partial repeal in 2022—cost American taxpayers and patients hundreds of billions of dollars. Tauzin's case illustrated how the revolving door transforms public servants into industry servants, with lucrative private sector jobs serving as rewards for favorable legislation. The episode contributed to growing public awareness of how corporate interests capture regulatory processes through strategic placement of former government officials.
