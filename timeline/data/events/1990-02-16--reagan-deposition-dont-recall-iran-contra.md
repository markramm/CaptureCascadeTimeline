Former President Ronald Reagan is questioned under oath in a videotaped deposition for the trial of former National Security Advisor John Poindexter, providing 293 pages of testimony in which he repeatedly claims he cannot recall virtually any specific details of the Iran-Contra affair. Reagan's extensive use of "I don't recall" and "I don't remember" becomes characteristic of his testimony strategy, allowing him to avoid providing incriminating information while technically not committing perjury.

When asked about approving letters to Congress, whether he knew about specific operations, or what instructions he gave to subordinates, Reagan consistently responds with variations of "Well, again, it's a case of memory, I don't recall." This pattern of convenient memory loss occurs throughout questioning about events that represented the biggest scandal of his presidency, raising questions about whether Reagan genuinely forgot or was employing a deliberate strategy to avoid accountability.

The deposition reveals Reagan claiming ignorance about the diversion of funds to the Contras, despite substantial evidence that senior administration officials including Vice President Bush and cabinet members were aware of the scheme. Reagan's inability to recall extends to basic facts about operations he allegedly authorized, policy discussions he participated in, and decisions made at National Security Council meetings he chaired.

Reagan's testimony demonstrates how powerful political figures can use claimed memory failures to escape accountability for illegal conduct. Unlike lower-level officials who faced prosecution for lying to Congress and obstructing justice, Reagan's position as former president combined with his "I don't recall" strategy shields him from consequences. The deposition establishes a template for executive impunity where the highest officials claim ignorance about illegal operations conducted by subordinates, allowing them to maintain deniability while their underlings take the fall for implementing policies the executives tacitly approved.
