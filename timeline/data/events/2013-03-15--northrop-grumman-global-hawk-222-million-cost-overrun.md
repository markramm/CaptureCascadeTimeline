Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drone program experienced massive cost escalation, with per-unit costs exploding from an initial $60.9 million in 2001 to $222.7 million per aircraft (including development costs) by 2013—a nearly four-fold increase that forced the Air Force to slash planned procurement from 63 aircraft to just 45. The program's total cost surged from an original March 2001 estimate of $5.394 billion to $6.281 billion by December 2003, representing a $900 million increase, with development expenses alone increasing almost threefold from $906.2 million to approximately $2.6 billion.

The Government Accountability Office documented severe program management failures in its December 2004 report, finding that program acquisition unit costs had risen 44 percent from $85.6 million to $123.2 million per aircraft since program inception. The fiscal year 2006 budget request reached approximately $750 million—three times the original plan for that year—with peak funding projected at $781 million in fiscal 2007, more than double the $353 million originally planned for fiscal 2010. The GAO identified substantial knowledge gaps across critical areas including technology maturity for advanced sensors, design stability with only 75 percent of engineering drawings completed versus a 90 percent standard, and production maturity concerns with new manufacturing processes and subcontractor quality issues.

Most alarmingly, the GAO reported that the Air Force planned to invest in almost half of the total RQ-4B fleet before a production model was even flight-tested and proven operational, representing extremely high concurrency risk that exposed taxpayers to massive financial liability if the system failed to perform as specified. The GAO recommended that the Air Force create a new business case matching warfighter needs with available resources and delay procurement beyond test units until risks were reduced, but the Department of Defense disagreed with both recommendations and continued full-speed production despite the documented risks.

The Global Hawk cost overruns exemplify the systematic exploitation enabled by cost-plus defense contracting, where Northrop Grumman profits from program delays, design changes, and technical failures while taxpayers absorb all financial risk. The program's nearly 300 percent cost growth demonstrates how defense contractors manipulate acquisition processes, lowball initial cost estimates to win contracts, then extract vastly higher payments once programs are too politically entrenched to cancel. The Air Force's decision to ignore GAO warnings and proceed with concurrent production despite massive knowledge gaps shows how institutional capture of Pentagon leadership by defense industry interests overrides fiscal responsibility and accountability to taxpayers.

The Global Hawk program also raises severe civil liberties concerns as these high-altitude, long-endurance surveillance drones—capable of monitoring vast areas with sophisticated signals intelligence and electro-optical sensors for over 30 hours per flight—represent infrastructure for domestic surveillance and border militarization. The dramatic cost increases transferred billions in additional taxpayer funds to Northrop Grumman while building surveillance capabilities that civil liberties advocates warn threaten constitutional privacy protections and enable authoritarian monitoring of civilian populations.
