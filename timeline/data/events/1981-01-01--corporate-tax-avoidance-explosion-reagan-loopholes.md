Reagan's 1981 tax cuts create massive corporate tax loopholes through permissive depreciation rules and reduced rates, causing corporate tax revenue to plummet from 25% of federal revenue in the 1950s to just 6.2% by 1983. The tax law allows corporations to slash or erase tax obligations entirely through accelerated depreciation of equipment and other special credits, creating a windfall for profitable corporations while forcing middle-class taxpayers to shoulder greater tax burden. Major profitable corporations pay little or no federal income tax despite record profits, demonstrating how tax policy can be captured to serve corporate interests at public expense.

The corporate tax avoidance becomes so egregious that even Reagan recognizes the political liability: by 1986, he supports the Tax Reform Act closing many loopholes he had created five years earlier, producing what amounts to the biggest corporate tax increase in history. The 1986 reforms raise the overall effective corporate tax rate from just 14.1% in 1981-83 to 26.5% by 1988, proving the earlier loopholes were pure giveaways without economic justification. However, the pattern of corporate tax erosion continues: states abandon "worldwide combined reporting" requirements under pressure from multinational corporations and the Reagan administration, enabling the profit-shifting to offshore tax havens that explodes in the 1990s and 2000s.

The Reagan-era corporate tax cuts establish a template for future corporate tax avoidance: create loopholes favoring specific industries and large corporations, allow profit-shifting to low-tax jurisdictions, weaken IRS enforcement through budget cuts, and claim all cuts will be "paid for" through economic growth that never materializes. The result is systematic erosion of the corporate tax base, shifting fiscal burden onto working families through payroll taxes while corporations park profits offshore and use tax savings for stock buybacks and executive compensation rather than productive investment. Corporate tax avoidance becomes structural feature of American capitalism, enabled by Reagan-era ideology that corporations should be freed from social obligations.
