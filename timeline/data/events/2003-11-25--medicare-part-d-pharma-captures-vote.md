The House of Representatives passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act at 5:53 AM after an unprecedented 3-hour vote that House leaders held open for nearly three hours past the normal 15-minute voting period to secure enough votes. The legislation created Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage but included a "noninterference clause" that explicitly prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers—a provision the pharmaceutical industry had a major role in writing. This ban prevented Medicare from using its purchasing power to obtain discounts, ensuring maximum profits for drug companies at taxpayers' expense.

## Pharmaceutical Industry Writes Its Own Regulation

The noninterference clause represented one of the clearest examples of regulatory capture in modern American history. Pharmaceutical industry lobbyists worked directly with committee staff to draft language preventing Medicare price negotiation—effectively allowing the regulated industry to write its own regulation. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA), who shepherded the bill through Congress, was reportedly already negotiating his future employment with PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry's lobbying organization. The legislation also prevented Medicare from establishing a preferred drugs list or formulary, further limiting the government's ability to control costs.

## Market-Oriented Republicans and Industry Compromise

Republican leaders framed the noninterference clause as a "market-oriented" approach that would preserve competition and innovation. PhRMA spent over $231 million on lobbying in recent years—more than any other industry since 1998—creating the political infrastructure to shape legislation. The compromise attracted Republican votes by protecting pharmaceutical profits while appearing to expand Medicare benefits. Democrats who supported the bill accepted the industry's argument that negotiation bans were necessary to pass any prescription drug coverage, despite Veterans Administration and Medicaid programs successfully negotiating significant discounts.

## Unprecedented Vote Extension and Arm-Twisting

House Republican leadership held the vote open from 2:53 AM to 5:53 AM—nearly three hours instead of the standard 15 minutes—while party leaders pressured reluctant Republicans to change their votes. The bill was failing when the standard voting period expired, prompting Speaker Dennis Hastert and Majority Leader Tom DeLay to engage in extraordinary arm-twisting to secure passage. Representative Nick Smith (R-MI) later alleged that he was offered financial inducements for his son's congressional campaign in exchange for his vote, though investigations proved inconclusive. The extended vote became emblematic of how corporate interests could override normal legislative procedures when sufficient industry money and leadership pressure aligned.

## Significance

Medicare Part D's passage demonstrated pharmaceutical industry regulatory capture at its most brazen. The noninterference clause cost American taxpayers and patients hundreds of billions of dollars over the following two decades, with estimates suggesting Medicare paid 20-30% more for drugs than it would have with negotiating authority. The provision exemplified how industries could achieve through lobbying what they could never achieve through market competition—legal protection from price pressure. The revolving door connection between Chairman Tauzin and PhRMA—with his employment discussions occurring while he crafted the legislation—illustrated how deferred compensation shapes policy outcomes. The episode revealed that committee jurisdiction over industries created conflicts of interest when chairmen anticipated lucrative post-government employment with the sectors they regulated. The noninterference clause remained in effect until the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act partially repealed it, representing nearly two decades of industry-written policy that prioritized pharmaceutical profits over patient welfare and fiscal responsibility.
