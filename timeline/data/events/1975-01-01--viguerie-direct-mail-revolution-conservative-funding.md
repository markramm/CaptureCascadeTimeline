By the mid-1970s, Richard Viguerie had revolutionized conservative political fundraising through direct mail campaigns, building a massive donor network that would finance the New Right movement and create the infrastructure for corporate-funded "grassroots" activism. Dubbed the "funding father" of modern conservative strategy, Viguerie transformed how conservative causes mobilized financial support while maintaining an appearance of grassroots spontaneity.

In early 1965, Viguerie went to the clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and copied by longhand 12,500 donors who had contributed to Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. He grew this list from 12,500 to 125,000 donors in just one year - a 1,000% increase. Before the end of the 1960s, Viguerie had a million names in his files, adding many millions more as the New Right remade Republican politics in the 1970s.

Viguerie's direct mail operation became central to the "New Right" - a group of conservative activists including Paul Weyrich, Morton Blackwell, Howard Phillips, and Terry Dolan who built an effective political force for the Republican Party. By the mid-to-late 1970s, Viguerie's development and honing of national direct mail campaigns was considered revolutionary and was quickly adopted by insurgent conservative political campaigns.

The system allowed Viguerie to pool mailing lists from various clients, enabling cross-promotion between different conservative causes. Anti-tax activists could receive messaging about abortion, while religious voters concerned about abortion received anti-tax messaging. This created an integrated conservative movement where corporate economic interests and cultural conservative issues were strategically bundled.

Viguerie financed right-wing organizations and politicians including George Wallace, Jesse Helms, and Ronald Reagan. His direct mail empire enabled conservative organizations to bypass traditional party structures and media gatekeepers, creating what appeared to be spontaneous grassroots movements but were actually well-funded, coordinated campaigns directed by corporate-backed strategists.

The direct mail revolution demonstrated how conservative infrastructure could manufacture apparent grassroots support for corporate agendas, building donor networks that would sustain Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority, and other Powell Memo institutions for decades.
