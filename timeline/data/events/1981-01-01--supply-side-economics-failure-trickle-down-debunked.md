Empirical evidence systematically disproves Reagan's supply-side economic theory—the claim that tax cuts for the wealthy would generate economic growth benefiting all Americans through "trickle-down" effects. Statistical analysis reveals the correlation coefficient between top tax rates and GDP growth is essentially zero (0.03), meaning no connection exists between cutting taxes for the wealthy and economic expansion. Two of the three highest-growth years in American history occurred during the 1950s when top marginal tax rates stood at 91%, directly contradicting supply-side predictions. Reagan's tax cuts of 1981 and 1986 fail to accelerate growth beyond rates achieved in prior or subsequent decades, while tripling the national debt from $1 trillion to $3 trillion.

Reagan's own budget director David Stockman privately expresses doubts about supply-side theory, admitting to journalists that the Kemp-Roth tax cut was merely "a way to rebrand a tax cut for the top income bracket" rather than legitimate economic policy. Economist Greg Mankiw describes Reagan's economic advisers as "charlatans and cranks" for claiming broad-based income tax cuts would raise revenue through growth, estimating that such cuts recoup only about 25% of lost revenue. The promised investment boom never materializes: wealthy recipients of tax cuts use savings for speculation, asset accumulation, and offshore tax avoidance rather than job-creating productive investment.

Supply-side economics represents ideologically-driven policy masquerading as science. Proponents like Arthur Laffer promise tax cuts would be "self-financing" through growth, but instead produce record deficits. The theory predicts prosperity would "trickle down" to workers, but real wages stagnate while inequality explodes. It claims deregulation would spur investment, but instead enables fraud and financial crisis. The gap between supply-side promises and empirical reality reveals the theory serves primarily as justification for upward wealth redistribution: tax cuts for the wealthy don't generate broad-based growth, they generate more wealth for the wealthy. Despite overwhelming evidence of failure, supply-side orthodoxy dominates Republican policy for four decades.
