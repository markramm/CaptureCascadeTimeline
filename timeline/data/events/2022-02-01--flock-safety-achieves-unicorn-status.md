Flock Safety announces $150 million Series E funding round led by Tiger Global, achieving a post-money valuation of $3.5 billion and cementing its status as a surveillance unicorn. Additional investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, Meritech, and Initialized Capital, bringing total funding to $380 million.

By this point, Flock has pivoted from its initial HOA neighborhood focus to partnering with over 1,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide, creating an interconnected automated license plate recognition (ALPR) network that performs billions of scans monthly. The company's rapid expansion demonstrates how venture capital has accelerated the deployment of warrantless surveillance infrastructure across American communities.

More than 75% of law enforcement agencies opt into Flock's nationwide data sharing, creating a de facto national vehicle tracking database accessible to thousands of police departments without warrant requirements or meaningful privacy protections. What began as a neighborhood security solution has transformed into mass surveillance infrastructure that tracks the movements of millions of Americans.

The valuation comes less than a year after their Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz in July 2021, reflecting investor enthusiasm for public safety technology despite mounting civil liberties concerns about automated tracking and data retention.
