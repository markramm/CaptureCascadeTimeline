Federal regulators seize Lincoln Savings and Loan, ending Charles Keating's systematic fraud scheme that ultimately costs taxpayers $2.3 billion—one of the costliest S&L failures in American history. The seizure comes after years of regulatory delays caused by political interference from five U.S. Senators (the "Keating Five") who received $1.5 million in campaign contributions from Keating in exchange for pressuring regulators to halt enforcement actions. Lincoln had grown from $1.1 billion in assets when Keating purchased it in 1984 to $5.5 billion through fraudulent bond sales, risky real estate speculation, and accounting manipulations enabled by deregulation and regulatory capture.

The Lincoln failure reveals the full scope of S&L crisis corruption: Keating used federally-insured deposits to fund high-risk investments and personal enrichment while regulators who attempted oversight faced political pressure from captured senators. Keating sold $250 million in uninsured subordinated debentures to Lincoln customers, many elderly, by misleading them into believing the bonds were federally insured like deposits. When Lincoln collapsed, 23,000 bondholders lost their life savings. The fraud was documented in detail by whistleblower regulators who faced retaliation for attempting to stop Keating's activities before losses reached catastrophic levels.

Lincoln's seizure forces public recognition that the S&L crisis stems from systematic fraud enabled by deregulation and political corruption, not merely economic conditions. The Keating Five investigation exposes how campaign contributions purchase regulatory forbearance, allowing fraud to continue until losses reach taxpayer-bailout scale. Three of the five senators receive official reprimands, though none face criminal charges despite clear quid pro quo arrangements. Keating himself is eventually convicted of fraud and serves prison time, but the institutional rot that enabled his fraud—weak regulation, political corruption, moral hazard from deposit insurance—remains largely unaddressed until FIRREA passes months later.
