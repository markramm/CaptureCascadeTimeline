The Reagan administration prohibits Surgeon General C. Everett Koop from publicly addressing the emerging AIDS epidemic from 1981 through early 1986, demonstrating deliberate suppression of public health information during a catastrophic disease outbreak. Journalists receive advance instructions from administration officials that Koop "will not answer questions about AIDS" and "is not to be asked about it" during press conferences. Reagan's domestic policy advisers relegate Koop to the sidelines during the first five years of the epidemic as deaths mount, viewing AIDS as a political liability that might alienate the president's conservative evangelical base.

In February 1986, nearly five years after the epidemic began, President Reagan finally instructs Koop to prepare a report on AIDS. Concerned that in-depth review by Reagan's domestic policy team would lead to removal of crucial public health information, Koop drafts the report himself at a stand-up desk in his home basement with only a handful of trusted staff advisers. He submits numbered copies to the Domestic Policy Council and collects them at the meeting's end to prevent alterations. The October 1986 "Surgeon General's Report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome" becomes a landmark document providing frank guidance on prevention, including controversial recommendations for comprehensive sex education and condom use.

The five-year muzzling of the nation's chief public health officer during an epidemic demonstrates how political ideology can directly cause mass death. By the time Koop is permitted to address AIDS publicly in 1986, over 12,000 Americans have died and the epidemic has spread into populations that could have been reached with earlier prevention education. Koop later becomes a vocal critic of the administration's AIDS inaction, noting that public health science was subordinated to political calculation and religious conservatism. The episode reveals that Reagan administration officials feared alienating anti-gay conservative voters more than they feared an epidemic killing thousands of Americans.
