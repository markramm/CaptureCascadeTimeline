title: "Dennis Hastert Pleads Guilty to Federal Banking Violations"
summary: |
  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of structuring bank withdrawals to evade reporting requirements, admitting he illegally withdrew approximately $1.7 million in cash from multiple bank accounts in amounts under $10,000 to avoid triggering mandatory bank reporting. Under the plea agreement, the charge of making false statements to the FBI was dropped.

  Hastert acknowledged that the payments were made to an unnamed individual from his hometown of Yorkville, Illinois, to conceal both the transactions and details about past sexual misconduct when he was a high school wrestling coach. Media reports confirmed the funds were hush money related to sexual abuse of students decades earlier. Former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer noted: "Why he structured the money is irrelevant. He could've woken up a given day and just decided to start structuring money for absolutely no reason, and that's a crime."

  At age 73, Hastert faced a maximum of five years in prison, though prosecutors recommended up to six months imprisonment. The guilty plea represented a dramatic fall for the longest-serving Republican House Speaker, who had once been third in line for the presidency. Sentencing was scheduled for February 2016. While the plea dealt only with banking violations—as the statute of limitations had expired on the underlying sexual abuse—it effectively confirmed that one of America's most powerful politicians had paid millions to cover up molesting teenagers while he was their coach.
