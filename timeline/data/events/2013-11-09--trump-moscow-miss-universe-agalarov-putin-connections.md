On November 9, 2013, Donald Trump brought the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, held at Crocus City Hall owned by Aras Agalarov—a Russian billionaire known as "Putin's Builder" with close Kremlin ties. During the event, Trump pursued meetings with Vladimir Putin (who sent a gift via Agalarov's daughter), finalized a formal business deal with Agalarov for Trump Tower Moscow, and tweeted that Putin might become his "new best friend." The relationship established Trump's financial dependence on Kremlin-connected Russian oligarchs and created potential leverage that would persist through his presidential campaign.

## The Agalarov Partnership

Aras Agalarov, the billionaire who brought Trump to Moscow, was deeply connected to Putin's inner circle:

**"Putin's Builder"**: Agalarov earned this nickname after Putin personally selected him to build massive infrastructure for the 2012 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vladivostok.

**Order of Honor**: In November 2013—the same month as Miss Universe—Putin awarded Agalarov the Russian Order of Honor, one of Russia's highest civilian awards.

**$14-20 Million Payment**: Agalarov reportedly paid Trump between $14-20 million to bring Miss Universe to Moscow—an unusually high fee that raised questions about whether it was payment for the pageant or something more.

**Crocus City Hall**: The Agalarov-owned venue where Miss Universe was held, demonstrating the oligarch's wealth and access to major infrastructure.

**Son Emin Agalarov**: A Russian pop star who would later facilitate the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer offering Clinton dirt.

## Trump's Pursuit of Putin

Trump's behavior during the Moscow visit revealed his eagerness for Putin's approval:

**Public Tweets**: Trump tweeted before the pageant: "Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow—if so, will he become my new best friend?"

**Putin's Absence**: Putin did not attend, citing a last-minute visit from the King of the Netherlands, though this may have been a diplomatic rebuff.

**The Gift**: Putin sent a gift to Trump through Agalarov's daughter—a black lacquered box containing a sealed letter from Putin. The letter's contents were never publicly disclosed.

**Symbolic Significance**: The gift established direct communication between Putin and Trump through the Agalarov intermediaries.

**Trump's Reaction**: Trump treasured the Putin gift, keeping it and frequently mentioning the gesture, revealing his susceptibility to Putin's cultivation.

## Trump Tower Moscow Deal

During the pageant, Trump finalized plans for his long-sought Moscow real estate project:

**Formal Business Deal**: Trump signed agreements with Agalarov to develop Trump Tower Moscow in November 2013.

**Public Announcement**: Trump tweeted on November 11, 2013: "TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next," publicly revealing the business relationship.

**Site Scouting**: In February 2014, Ivanka Trump flew to Moscow to scout potential sites for the project with Emin Agalarov, demonstrating the Trump Organization's serious commitment.

**Kremlin Approval Required**: The project would require approval from Putin and the Kremlin due to its scale and prominent location in Moscow.

**Financial Motivation**: The deal demonstrated Trump's financial incentive to maintain good relations with Putin and Kremlin-connected oligarchs.

## The Kompromat Risk

Trump's November 2013 Moscow visit created multiple kompromat vulnerabilities:

**Surveillance Environment**: Trump's hotel accommodations in Moscow were certainly monitored by Russian intelligence services, as standard practice.

**Offers of Women**: Trump's bodyguard Keith Schiller later testified that he was offered prostitutes for Trump during the visit, which he declined—but this demonstrated Russian intelligence's approach methods.

**Dossier Allegations**: The Steele Dossier later alleged compromising behavior during this Moscow visit, though the specific claims remained unverified.

**Intelligence Collection**: Russian intelligence would have comprehensively documented Trump's activities, associations, and discussions during the high-profile visit.

**Financial Leverage**: The Trump Tower Moscow deal and Agalarov payment created financial leverage—Trump owed obligations to Kremlin-connected oligarchs.

## Pattern: Cultivating the Asset

The 2013 Miss Universe visit exemplified how Russian oligarchs cultivate American business figures:

**Step 1**: Lucrative business opportunity ($14-20 million for pageant).

**Step 2**: Access to Russian elite and infrastructure (Crocus City Hall, Moscow exposure).

**Step 3**: Symbolic presidential attention (Putin's gift).

**Step 4**: Major business deal with Kremlin approval required (Trump Tower Moscow).

**Step 5**: Ongoing financial dependence (project continued through 2016 campaign).

**Step 6**: Kompromat collection (surveillance during Moscow visit).

**Step 7**: Activation when useful (2016 election support).

This wasn't a conspiracy—it was standard Russian oligarchic cultivation of a potentially useful American business figure who might one day have political value.

## The Agalarovs as Intermediaries

The Agalarov family served as crucial intermediaries between Trump and Kremlin:

**Business Channel**: Provided legitimate business cover for Trump-Kremlin financial relationships.

**Social Access**: Introduced Trump to Russian elite and facilitated Putin contact.

**Continuous Relationship**: Maintained ongoing contact with Trump Organization through 2016.

**2016 Trump Tower Meeting**: Emin Agalarov and Rob Goldstone (Emin's publicist) arranged the June 9, 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer offering Clinton dirt—demonstrating the relationship's activation for political purposes.

**Intelligence Cutout**: The Agalarovs provided plausible deniability for direct Kremlin-Trump coordination while serving Kremlin objectives.

## Trump's Public Praise for Putin

During and after the Moscow visit, Trump began his pattern of praising Putin:

**MSNBC Interview**: "He's running his country and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country."

**"New Best Friend" Tweet**: Public expression of desire for Putin relationship.

**Consistent Pattern**: From 2013 forward, Trump rarely criticized Putin and frequently praised him, even when doing so was politically costly.

**Policy Alignment**: Trump's policy positions increasingly aligned with Russian interests, particularly regarding Ukraine, NATO, and sanctions.

## Financial Dependency Context

The 2013 Moscow visit occurred during Trump's period of maximum financial dependency on Russian money:

**US Bank Blacklist**: After multiple bankruptcies, most US banks refused Trump loans.

**Russian Money Flow**: As Trump Jr. admitted in 2008, "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets."

**Deutsche Bank**: Trump's primary lender Deutsche Bank was simultaneously involved in massive Russian money laundering.

**Trump Tower Moscow**: Represented potential billion-dollar project that required Kremlin approval and Russian financing.

**Oligarch Dependence**: Trump had become financially dependent on Kremlin-connected Russian oligarchs when US banks wouldn't lend to him.

## The Continuing Relationship

The Agalarov relationship persisted through Trump's presidential campaign:

**2015**: Trump signed Letter of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow project (October 28, 2015).

**2016**: Michael Cohen pursued the project through June 2016, during the campaign.

**Felix Sater**: Involved in the project, promising "I will get Putin to say that this project is good and valuable to our country."

**Campaign Lie**: Trump publicly denied Russian business dealings during the campaign while secretly pursuing the Moscow project.

**Mueller Investigation**: The Trump Tower Moscow pursuit during the campaign became a focus of obstruction investigation.

## Significance: Financial Leverage Creation

The 2013 Miss Universe visit and Trump Tower Moscow deal created multiple forms of leverage:

**Financial Obligation**: Trump owed significant business opportunities to Kremlin-connected oligarchs.

**Kompromat Potential**: Russian intelligence collected comprehensive information during the visit.

**Ongoing Deal**: The continuing Moscow project created sustained motivation to maintain Putin's favor.

**Public Record**: Trump's tweets about Putin and the project created evidence of the relationship that could be used against him.

**Family Involvement**: Ivanka's site scouting visit implicated Trump family in Russia business relationships.

When a major American business figure brings his beauty pageant to Moscow, partners with Putin's favorite oligarch, receives gifts from Putin, finalizes a major real estate deal requiring Kremlin approval, and publicly seeks Putin's friendship—he's not just doing business, he's creating multiple forms of dependency and leverage that a strategic foreign power can exploit.

## Pattern: Business to Political Leverage

The 2013 relationship established the foundation for later political exploitation:

**2013**: Business relationship and financial leverage created.

**2014**: Ivanka scouts Moscow sites, deepening family involvement.

**2015**: Trump announces presidential run while pursuing Moscow project.

**2016**: Russia supports Trump campaign; Agalarovs facilitate Trump Tower meeting.

**2017-2021**: Trump presidency implements notably pro-Russia policies despite intelligence community warnings.

The Miss Universe visit wasn't the beginning of Trump's Russia connections, but it crystallized the relationship in a way that would have consequences for American democracy three years later.

## Mueller Investigation Findings

The Special Counsel investigation documented the 2013 Moscow visit's significance:

**Business Context**: Established Trump's long-standing desire for Moscow real estate project.

**Financial Motivation**: Demonstrated Trump's financial incentives for maintaining Putin's favor.

**Campaign Lies**: Trump's false denials of Russian business dealings during campaign gained significance given the documented 2013 relationship.

**Obstruction Motive**: Trump's attempts to hide the Moscow project suggested consciousness of guilt about the Russia relationship.

**Pattern of Contact**: The Agalarov relationship exemplified broader pattern of Trump-Russia connections.

## Later Activation: The 2016 Trump Tower Meeting

The cultivation that began with the 2013 Moscow visit was activated three years later:

**June 3, 2016**: Rob Goldstone emails Trump Jr. offering Russian government dirt on Clinton "as part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."

**June 9, 2016**: Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower—meeting arranged by Emin Agalarov and Rob Goldstone.

**Trump Jr.'s Response**: "I love it especially later in the summer"—showing receptiveness established through the Agalarov relationship.

The 2013 cultivation made the 2016 approach possible. When Emin Agalarov's publicist offers "Russian government" help, Trump campaign leadership doesn't refuse or report it—they enthusiastically accept.

That's not because of a sudden 2016 conspiracy—it's because the relationship and mutual benefit had been established since 2013 (or earlier), making the political cooperation natural.

When American business figures become financially dependent on foreign oligarchs, allow foreign intelligence to collect kompromat, and publicly express desire for authoritarian leaders' friendship, they create vulnerabilities that can be exploited when they seek political power.

The November 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow wasn't just a business deal—it was a major step in Donald Trump's capture by Russian oligarchic interests that would have profound consequences for American democracy.
