The bipartisan discharge petition to force release of all Department of Justice files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation reached the critical threshold of 218 signatures on November 12, 2025, when Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) signed immediately after being sworn into office. Grijalva, who won a special election on September 23, 2025 to represent Arizona's 7th Congressional District following her father's death, became the decisive 218th signatory around 4:00 PM Eastern time, signing on the House floor as Democrats cheered and two Epstein survivors watched from the gallery. The petition forces a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, legislation introduced in July by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) that would compel the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related documents within 30 days, including flight logs, travel records, communications, and investigative files.

The successful petition represented a rare bipartisan coalition: all House Democrats plus exactly four Republicans—Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), and Nancy Mace (R-SC)—signed to bypass Speaker Mike Johnson's opposition and force a floor vote. Grijalva's swearing-in had been delayed for seven weeks by Speaker Johnson, who refused to administer the oath of office while Congress was in recess, a departure from his typical practice of swearing in new members within days of their election. Critics including Senator Ruben Gallego accused Johnson of deliberately preventing Grijalva from providing the petition's crucial 218th signature. Johnson denied any connection between the delay and the Epstein petition, calling such claims "totally absurd," but immediately after the petition succeeded, he reversed course and committed to expediting the process: "We're going to put that on the floor for a full vote next week, as soon as we get back," bypassing the standard seven-legislative-day waiting period required by House rules.

President Trump actively opposed the discharge petition effort in the hours before it succeeded. Trump and his administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel, pressured the four Republican signatories to withdraw their names. Rep. Lauren Boebert met with Trump Administration officials at the White House on November 12 regarding her support for the petition, while Trump and Rep. Nancy Mace reportedly engaged in "phone tag" for 24 hours before the petition reached 218 signatures. Despite this pressure from the White House, all four Republican signatories kept their names on the petition. The Trump administration's opposition reflected concerns about what the full release of Epstein files might reveal, given Trump's documented social relationship with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, including numerous photographs together, Trump's 2002 statement calling Epstein a "terrific guy" who "likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side," and flight records showing Trump traveled on Epstein's private jets.

The discharge petition's success represented a significant defeat for both Speaker Johnson and President Trump, demonstrating that rank-and-file members could force accountability on the Epstein investigation despite leadership opposition. The petition required 218 signatures—a majority of the 435-member House—to trigger a mandatory floor vote under House rules, a rarely successful parliamentary maneuver typically used to bypass committee bottlenecks or leadership obstruction. The Epstein Files Transparency Act would require the Justice Department to declassify and publicly release all documents related to its investigation of Epstein's sex trafficking operation, potentially revealing information about Epstein's associates, co-conspirators, and clients that has been withheld from public scrutiny despite years of congressional oversight requests and Freedom of Information Act litigation.
