  "title": "State Policy Network Organizational Profile: Coordinating 66 State Think Tanks for Synchronized Corporate Capture",
  "summary": "Comprehensive organizational analysis reveals State Policy Network (SPN) as coordination hub for 66+ state-level think tanks implementing nationally-coordinated corporate agenda while maintaining appearance of grassroots state-level research. Founded in 1992 by Thomas A. Roe (Heritage Foundation trustee), SPN provides central coordination, funding distribution, messaging consistency, and strategic support to state affiliates including Mackinac Center (Michigan), Texas Public Policy Foundation, Illinois Policy Institute, and dozens of others. This creates powerful synchronization mechanism: when corporate interests want specific policy replicated across states, SPN coordinates simultaneous campaigns with state-branded 'research' providing local legitimacy.\n\nSTRUCTURE AND MEMBERSHIP: SPN coordinates 66 affiliate members (mostly state think tanks) and 99 associate members including Americans for Prosperity, Heritage Foundation, ALEC, and DonorsTrust. This structure links state-level advocacy to national conservative infrastructure while maintaining plausible deniability of centralized control. SPN operates as policy, communications, and litigation arm for ALEC, giving ALEC's cookie-cutter corporate legislation 'sheen of academic legitimacy and state-based support.' The network raised $152 million annually by 2022, distributed across member organizations to create appearance of independent state research while executing nationally-coordinated strategy.\n\nFUNDING COORDINATION: Bradley Foundation created Bradley Freedom Grants Program with SPN, providing $1.25 million to member think tanks (2020) while funneling additional millions directly to state affiliates. DonorsTrust provided $10 million to SPN (2008-2013), with $2 million in 2011 alone accounting for 40% of annual revenue. This funding structure creates coordinated dark money distribution network: anonymous billionaire donors give to DonorsTrust, which distributes to SPN, which allocates to state think tanks, which produce 'research' supporting donor interests—with complete anonymity at every stage. The multi-layered structure obscures that same handful of billionaires fund apparently diverse state think tanks.\n\nPOLICY AGENDA: SPN coordinates campaigns to privatize education (charter schools, vouchers), implement right-to-work laws destroying union funding, enact voter ID laws restricting voting access, oppose climate regulations, eliminate minimum wage laws, cut corporate taxes, curb business regulations, and hide political donor identities. The agenda is remarkably consistent across all 66 state affiliates, demonstrating centralized coordination despite local branding. Texas Public Policy Foundation pushed voter ID and election restrictions. Mackinac Center championed Michigan's right-to-work law and school privatization. Illinois Policy Institute attacked public sector unions. Each state affiliate provides 'independent research' reaching identical conclusions.\n\nMACHINISM AND COORDINATION: SPN enables synchronized state-level campaigns impossible for single national organization. When corporate interests want right-to-work laws nationwide, SPN coordinates simultaneous campaigns in multiple states with state-branded think tanks providing 'local research' on each state's 'unique' need for union-busting. This creates false impression of organic state-level momentum rather than nationally-coordinated corporate campaign. State legislators receive 'research' from in-state think tank (Mackinac Center, not Heritage Foundation), making corporate agenda appear as Michigan-specific policy conclusion rather than imported corporate talking points.\n\nCAPTURE MECHANISM: SPN perfects state-level capture through coordinated decentralization. National funders (Bradley, DonorsTrust, Koch network) provide resources through central hub (SPN) to state organizations (Mackinac, TPPF, etc.) which produce locally-branded advocacy implementing nationally-determined corporate agenda. This structure defeats democratic accountability at every level: voters don't know state think tank is controlled by out-of-state billionaires, legislators don't recognize coordinated campaign because each state's 'research' appears independent, media quotes state experts unaware they're executing national strategy. The result is corporate capture of state policy infrastructure disguised as decentralized state-level research.",
