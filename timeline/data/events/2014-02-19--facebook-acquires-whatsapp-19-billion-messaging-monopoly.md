Facebook acquires WhatsApp for $19 billion, the largest tech acquisition to date, eliminating its primary competitor in mobile messaging and consolidating monopoly control over personal communications platforms. The FTC approves the acquisition without structural separation requirements despite clear anticompetitive intent.

## The Acquisition Strategy

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg orchestrated the $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp to neutralize what internal documents described as an existential competitive threat to Facebook's dominance in personal communications. At the time of acquisition, WhatsApp had over 450 million monthly active users and was adding approximately 1 million new users daily, directly threatening Facebook's mobile messaging dominance through its simple, ad-free model.

Morgan Stanley analysts noted that Google would have rivaled Facebook if the search giant had acquired WhatsApp first, demonstrating the strategic importance of eliminating this competitor. The acquisition followed Facebook's "buy or bury" strategy documented in internal communications, where Zuckerberg systematically identified and acquired potential competitors before they could challenge Facebook's monopoly position.

## Regulatory Failure and Data Privacy Violations

The FTC approved the acquisition with only privacy-focused warnings rather than antitrust scrutiny, representing a catastrophic failure of regulatory oversight. The Commission notified both companies of their privacy obligations but imposed no structural separation requirements that would have preserved competition in the messaging market.

Facebook immediately violated its promises to regulators and users about data separation. Despite assurances that WhatsApp would remain independent and user data would not be shared with Facebook, the company began integrating WhatsApp data into its advertising targeting systems within months of the acquisition closing. This data integration allowed Facebook to expand its surveillance capitalism infrastructure across messaging platforms while eliminating the competitive pressure that had kept WhatsApp ad-free.

## Monopolization Pattern

The WhatsApp acquisition was part of Facebook's systematic monopolization strategy documented by the FTC in its December 2020 antitrust lawsuit. Following the Instagram acquisition in 2012, the WhatsApp purchase eliminated Facebook's last major competitor in mobile social communications, giving the company monopoly control over personal networking and messaging with over 3 billion combined users across its platforms.

Former FTC Chair Lina Khan characterized both acquisitions as implementing a "buy-or-bury scheme" where Facebook systematically purchased competitors to maintain monopoly power rather than competing through innovation. The acquisition enabled Facebook to control 80% of the mobile social networking market and virtually all mobile messaging in most countries, creating insurmountable barriers to entry for future competitors.

The FTC's antitrust lawsuit seeks to unwind both the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, but the regulatory failure to block these monopolistic mergers at the time allowed Facebook to consolidate unprecedented power over global communications infrastructure with minimal oversight or accountability.
