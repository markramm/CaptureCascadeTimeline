South Central Inter-County Phone Network (SCIPNet)—a four-county Pennsylvania consortium comprising Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin, and Franklin counties—successfully deployed Carbyne APEX cloud-native emergency call-handling platform in September 2024, becoming the first Next Generation 911 system in Pennsylvania and securing $2.6 million in State Interoperability Grants to offset the $3.5 million total contract cost. The deployment brought AI-driven real-time language translation, surge call mitigation, live video streaming, instant messaging, and comprehensive multimedia data integration into a unified platform serving central Pennsylvania's emergency response infrastructure.

The four counties formed SCIPNet through an intergovernmental agreement in 2022 specifically to pursue joint Next Generation 911 capabilities, with each agency reportedly saving $1 million through the state grant program compared to individual procurement. Centers deploying Carbyne's AI-based translation services experienced an average of 5 minutes reduced call time, while the platform's surge mitigation capabilities addressed call volume spikes during mass casualty incidents or severe weather events. The consortium's coordinated approach and state funding enabled rapid deployment of Israeli Unit 8200-developed technology across a strategically significant region of Pennsylvania encompassing the state capital (Harrisburg in Dauphin County) and approaching the Pennsylvania-Maryland border.

The Pennsylvania deployment marked escalating state-level adoption of Carbyne's comprehensive surveillance infrastructure following the company's June 2023 AT&T partnership and expanding municipal contracts across Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, and Utah. By securing substantial state grant funding and positioning the technology as cost-saving modernization rather than foreign intelligence-adjacent surveillance capability, SCIPNet's $3.5 million contract legitimized large-scale government investment in technology developed by Israeli military intelligence veterans, funded by Ehud Barak and Jeffrey Epstein, and subsequently backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and AT&T Ventures. The four-county regional approach created a template for state-supported expansion of Carbyne's data extraction capabilities—smartphone GPS location, live video, text messages, and device data during every 911 call—across broader geographic areas through intergovernmental agreements and state funding mechanisms, accelerating penetration of US emergency communications infrastructure beyond individual municipal contracts.
