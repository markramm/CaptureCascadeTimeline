The "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia brought together neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and far-right extremists to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally descended into violence, culminating in a deadly terror attack when James Alex Fields Jr., a 21-year-old avowed white supremacist from Ohio, deliberately drove his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters.

## The Attack

At approximately 1:45 p.m., Fields stopped his car, backed up, then accelerated at high speed into the crowd of counter-demonstrators. According to Department of Justice documents, Fields "intended to kill the other victims he struck and injured with his car" and admitted during his plea hearing that he "drove into the crowd of counter-protestors because of the actual and perceived race, color, national origin, and religion of its members."

Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist attending her first protest, was killed instantly. Nearly three dozen others suffered devastating injuries requiring long, complicated recoveries. Fields had posted Nazi imagery on social media and, three months before the attack, shared a meme depicting a car plowing into protesters with bodies flying through the air.

## Trump's Response and Political Impact

President Trump's initial response drew immediate condemnation when he blamed "both sides" for the violence, refusing to condemn the white supremacist attackers. His moral equivocation between neo-Nazis and anti-racism protesters marked a watershed moment in normalizing far-right extremism in American politics.

The rally and its aftermath became a defining moment for the modern white nationalist movement in America. Participants included prominent far-right figures who would go on to play significant roles in later anti-democratic movements, including the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.

## Legal Consequences

Fields would later be convicted of first-degree murder and federal hate crimes. A jury found he committed an act of domestic terrorism motivated by white supremacist ideology. His trial revealed extensive evidence of his neo-Nazi beliefs and premeditation. He would ultimately receive life imprisonment plus 419 years for his crimes.
