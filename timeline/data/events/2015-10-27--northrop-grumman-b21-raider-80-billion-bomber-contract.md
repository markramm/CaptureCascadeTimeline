The U.S. Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman a development contract for the B-21 Raider Long Range Strike Bomber on October 27, 2015, with an initial value of $21.4 billion that could eventually reach $80 billion over the program's lifetime, representing one of the largest defense contracts in history and cementing Northrop's dominance in strategic stealth bomber development. The Air Force issued the request for proposals in July 2014 and selected Northrop Grumman over a joint bid from Boeing and Lockheed Martin based primarily on cost considerations, with plans to purchase at least 100 of the stealth intercontinental strategic bombers capable of delivering both conventional and thermonuclear weapons.

Boeing and Lockheed Martin protested the contract award through the Government Accountability Office, arguing that the selection process was flawed, but the GAO denied their protest on February 16, 2016, and sustained the Air Force's decision to award the massive contract to Northrop Grumman. The protest delay temporarily halted work on the program, but Northrop resumed development immediately after the GAO ruling, solidifying the company's position as the sole provider of America's next-generation strategic bomber fleet. In September 2016, the Air Force announced the aircraft would be named "Raider" in honor of the Doolittle Raiders, the World War II aviators who conducted the first air raid on Japan.

The B-21 contract award demonstrates Northrop Grumman's strategic capture of the stealth bomber market, as the company now holds a monopoly on U.S. strategic stealth bomber production with both the legacy B-2 Spirit fleet and the future B-21 Raider program. This market dominance creates severe vendor lock-in where the Air Force has zero alternative suppliers for stealth bomber technology, production capacity, or maintenance expertise, enabling Northrop to dictate terms and prices with minimal competitive pressure. The company's experience building the B-2—despite that program's massive cost overruns and technical failures—apparently provided sufficient competitive advantage to win the B-21 despite being the contractor responsible for the $44 billion B-2 debacle.

The $80 billion potential contract value represents conservative estimates that will almost certainly escalate dramatically based on Northrop's track record with stealth bomber programs. The B-2 program's per-unit costs increased nearly 400 percent from original estimates, and maintenance costs reached $150,000 per flight hour due to fragile stealth coatings and complex systems. If the B-21 follows similar cost growth patterns, the total program cost could exceed $200 billion when including development, procurement, sustainment, and upgrades over the fleet's projected 50-year service life. The Air Force's decision to award the contract based on cost considerations rings hollow given that Northrop submitted the "winning" bid while simultaneously demonstrating through the B-2 program that its stealth bomber cost estimates bear no relationship to actual expenses.

The B-21 program exemplifies how defense contractors profit from nuclear weapons modernization and the expansion of offensive military capabilities, as the bomber is explicitly designed to deliver thermonuclear weapons as part of the nuclear triad modernization estimated to cost over $1.5 trillion. Northrop Grumman's $80 billion contract ensures the company will remain a primary beneficiary of nuclear weapons spending for decades, profiting from the perpetual threat of nuclear war and the arms race dynamics that justify trillion-dollar investments in weapons of mass destruction. The stealth bomber's intercontinental range and nuclear payload capabilities enable first-strike scenarios that destabilize nuclear deterrence and increase the risk of catastrophic conflict, yet Northrop Grumman profits handsomely from developing these destabilizing capabilities with minimal public debate about the strategic wisdom or moral implications of next-generation nuclear bombers.
