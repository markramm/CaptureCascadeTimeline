On October 23, 2018, three weeks after Jamal Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, President Trump publicly acknowledges the killing was orchestrated by Saudi Arabia but makes clear he will not hold Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman accountable. Despite calling Saudi Arabia's handling of the assassination the "worst cover-up ever," Trump prioritizes arms deals and the U.S.-Saudi relationship over justice for the murdered Washington Post journalist.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump states: "They had a very bad original concept. It was carried out poorly, and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups." He adds: "There should have never been an execution or a cover-up, because it should have never happened. I would say it was a total fiasco from day one."

## No Accountability Despite Recognition

Despite acknowledging Saudi responsibility for the murder, Trump explicitly defers accountability decisions to Congress rather than taking executive action. When asked about consequences, Trump states: "I'm going to leave it up to Congress." His stance remains ambiguous and inconsistent—while earlier threatening the kingdom with "very severe" consequences and mentioning possible economic sanctions, he now offers more conciliatory remarks.

Trump emphasizes Saudi Arabia's role as a U.S. ally against Iran and highlights the country's importance as a major purchaser of American arms. Throughout his comments, Trump repeatedly cites economic ties with the kingdom as a reason to maintain the relationship despite the murder of a U.S. resident journalist.

## Administration's Limited Response

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces plans for visa revocations and individual sanctions under human rights laws, but these measures target only the specific operatives involved—not senior Saudi leadership or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who U.S. intelligence agencies assess ordered the killing.

Trump sends CIA Director Gina Haspel to Turkey to investigate and says he expects a report "soon," but ultimately declines to commit to specific punitive measures independently. The president's focus on arms sales and regional alliances signals that he will not allow the murder to fundamentally disrupt U.S.-Saudi relations.

## Significance

Trump's response establishes a pattern that will continue through his presidency: acknowledging Saudi Arabia's responsibility for Khashoggi's murder while refusing to hold Crown Prince MBS personally accountable. By calling the cover-up the "worst in history" yet deferring action to Congress and emphasizing economic ties, Trump makes clear that arms deals and geopolitical alliances take priority over accountability for the murder of a journalist and U.S. resident.

The "worst cover-up ever" framing is particularly notable—Trump is not saying the murder itself was the worst act, but rather criticizing the Saudis for executing it so poorly that they got caught. This language suggests Trump's primary objection is to the incompetence of the operation, not the killing of a dissident journalist.

This moment sets the stage for Trump's even more explicit defense of Saudi Arabia one month later, when the CIA concludes with high confidence that Crown Prince MBS ordered the murder.
