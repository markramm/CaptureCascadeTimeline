Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva was officially sworn into the United States House of Representatives on November 12, 2025—fifty days after winning a special election on September 23, 2025. The extraordinary seven-week delay, the longest in modern Congressional history, left more than 800,000 Arizonans in her 7th Congressional District without representation during a critical period that included a record-breaking government shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson administered the oath of office to loud applause from Democrats, ending weeks of controversy over his refusal to seat the newly elected representative.

Grijalva won the special election to fill the seat of her father, Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, who died on March 13, 2025, at age 77 from complications related to cancer treatments. The elder Grijalva had served 12 terms in Congress since first being elected in 2002, chaired the House Natural Resources Committee, and previously led the Congressional Progressive Caucus. His daughter, a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors, won a competitive Democratic primary and special election to succeed him in representing Arizona's 7th District, which includes parts of Tucson and runs along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Speaker Johnson initially delayed Grijalva's swearing-in during the government shutdown that followed his dismissal of lawmakers in mid-September, citing the need to wait until government operations resumed. However, Grijalva and critics alleged the delay was politically motivated, pointing to her vocal campaign promise to sign a bipartisan discharge petition to release Jeffrey Epstein files. Grijalva stated: "I do believe that there is absolutely a connection" between the delay and her Epstein petition support, arguing the postponement "resulted in denying representation to more than 800,000 Arizonans for the last seven weeks." The state of Arizona even filed a lawsuit against the House of Representatives over the unprecedented delay, though Johnson maintained his decision was not motivated by the discharge petition.

Immediately after being sworn in and delivering brief remarks on the House floor, Grijalva signed the discharge petition to force a vote on releasing complete Department of Justice files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her signature provided the critical 218th vote needed to trigger the procedural mechanism that bypasses House leadership to force a floor vote on legislation. Grijalva declared "Justice cannot wait another day" and emphasized the importance of the petition for survivors, including Liz Stein and Jessica Michaels, who were present in the gallery. The discharge petition, led by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, requires a seven-legislative-day ripening period before a vote can occur—expected in early December after the Thanksgiving recess. Grijalva's swearing-in and decisive petition signature marked a significant victory for transparency advocates who have demanded the full release of Epstein-related documents, though the lengthy delay in seating her raised serious questions about partisan manipulation of House procedures to prevent members from exercising their constitutional duties.
