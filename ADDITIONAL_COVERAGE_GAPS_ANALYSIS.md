## Research Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (8-10 events):
**Second Impeachment** - Critical historical gap, completely missing the impeachment process itself despite having 53 Jan 6-related events

### High Priority (12-15 events):
- **E. Jean Carroll cases** (4-5 events) - Court-proven sexual abuse, major accountability
- **COVID Response failures** (6-8 events) - "Hoax" claims, disinfectant, superspreaders
- **Access Hollywood** (2-3 events) - Critical 2016 campaign event

### Medium Priority (6-10 events):
- **Charlottesville** (2-3 events) - "Very fine people" is historically significant
- **Family Separation** (3-4 events) - Humanitarian crisis, needs fuller documentation
- **Supreme Court nomination details** (verification)

### Lower Priority:
- **2023-2024 indictments** - Likely already well-covered, just verify

---

## Total Additional Events Needed

- **Second Impeachment**: 8 events (Importance: 9-10/10)
- **E. Jean Carroll**: 5 events (Importance: 8-9/10)
- **COVID Response**: 8 events (Importance: 7-9/10)
- **Access Hollywood**: 3 events (Importance: 8-9/10)
- **Charlottesville**: 3 events (Importance: 7-9/10)
- **Family Separation**: 4 events (Importance: 8-9/10)

**Total**: 31 additional events to reach comprehensive coverage

**Timeline would reach**: ~2,295 events (most complete Trump accountability documentation)

---

## Conclusion

The timeline is now in **excellent shape** after adding 227 events today. The most critical remaining gap is the **Second Impeachment** (8-10 events), which should be prioritized given its historical significance. The other gaps are moderate but would complete the comprehensive documentation of Trump's first term accountability failures.
