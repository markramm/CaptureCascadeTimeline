# ALEC State-Level Capture Research Plan
## Critical Gap: Powell Memo Implementation at State Level

**Priority**: SEVERE
**Current Coverage**: Minimal (ALEC founding event exists, implementation barely documented)
**Target**: 30-40 comprehensive events documenting ALEC's systematic state legislative capture
**Importance Range**: 7-10/10

---

## Overview

ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council) is the **primary implementation mechanism** for the Powell Memo's corporate legislative strategy. Founded 1973, ALEC has drafted over 1,000 model bills passed in state legislatures, affecting:
- Labor rights (right-to-work, union busting)
- Voting access (voter ID, restrictions)
- Criminal justice (private prisons, mandatory minimums)
- Environmental regulation (climate denial, fracking)
- Education (school privatization)
- Healthcare (ACA opposition)
- Taxation (corporate tax cuts)

**Why This Is Severe**: ALEC represents the **actual mechanism** of corporate capture - not just influence, but corporations literally writing legislation passed by state governments. This is kleptocracy infrastructure operating at industrial scale.

## Why This Research Matters

ALEC is the **missing link** in the timeline's kleptocracy documentation:

1. **Powell Memo Implementation**: ALEC is how the Powell Memo's corporate legislative strategy actually got implemented at scale
2. **Scale of Capture**: 1/3 of state legislators, 1,000+ model bills, affecting 330 million Americans
3. **Cross-Domain**: Labor, voting, prisons, environment, taxes, education - total systemic capture
4. **Mechanism Documentation**: Not just outcomes, but HOW corporations write and pass legislation
5. **Democratic Erosion**: State legislatures captured by corporate interests, voters disenfranchised

Without ALEC documentation, the timeline shows **effects** but not **mechanism**. This research fills that critical gap.

## Next Steps

1. Launch research agents for Batch ALEC-1 (foundation, 8 events)
2. Create comprehensive events with 3+ tier-1 sources each
3. Proceed through batches sequentially
4. Cross-reference with existing timeline events
5. Complete all 40 events within 2-3 weeks
