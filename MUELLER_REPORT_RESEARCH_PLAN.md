# Mueller Report Research Execution Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses critical coverage gaps in the Mueller Investigation timeline identified in `MUELLER_REPORT_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`. The timeline currently has solid coverage of political/corruption aspects but is missing formal legal accountability milestones that define the investigation's historical significance.

**Goal**: Create 18 high-quality events documenting indictments, guilty pleas, sentencing, report release, and testimony.

**Expected Timeline**: 3 research batches executed in parallel

**Repository**: CaptureCascadeTimeline (Markdown format)
