# Phase 6: Corporate Crime & Regulatory Capture - Research Plan
**Date**: 2025-11-11
**Target**: 115 events across 8 topic areas
**Focus**: Documenting accountability collapse in corporate America (2000s-2020s)

## Overview

This phase fills critical gaps in corporate accountability documentation, showing the systematic pattern where corporate executives face no criminal consequences for fraud, deception, and negligence causing mass death and financial harm. These events demonstrate regulatory capture, revolving door corruption, and the replacement of criminal prosecution with deferred prosecution agreements and fines.

**Key Theme**: Contrast between brief 2002 Enron-era accountability (executives jailed, Sarbanes-Oxley passed) and 2008-2020 accountability collapse (zero prosecutions despite admitted fraud, mass death).

## Research Execution Plan

### Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Launch all 8 batches in parallel (8 research agents)**
- Fastest completion
- All 118 events created simultaneously
- Single large commit afterward

**Option 2: Sequential batches (Tier 1 first, then Tier 2)**
- Batch 6A-6D first (62 events, CRITICAL priority)
- Then 6E-6H (56 events, MEDIUM-HIGH/MEDIUM)
- Allows for review between tiers

**Option 3: Two-phase approach**
- Phase 6A: Batches 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D (62 events - corporate crime)
